<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) has the potential to become a technology that will help to use a holistic information repository to generate and represent relevant information in different stages of the building lifecycle to dedicated groups of stakeholders. Substantial efforts were made in the past to develop open, well-documented meta-data models and complement dictionaries to ensure integrated, semantically harmonised data management. The buildingSmart Consortium supports the development and maintenance of one of the most prominent openBIM meta-data models currently available, called Industry Foundation Classes (IFC).</p><p>The IFC-meta data model is very comprehensive. Building elements and building processes can be described using numerous additional classes and property sets. However, there is a need to clearly specify when (i.e. at what stage of a building's lifecycle), by whom (i.e. stakeholder or role) and what level such information must be added to a BIM model. To specify this, two distinct concepts were developed and defined by the AECO community, such as Levels of Detail (LOD) and Building Lifecycle Stages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The concept of Levels of Detail (LOD) represents the scope and completeness of the information that is required for a building's documentation (be it digitally or not). In some cases, this classification is broken down in the level of geometrical objects (or the level of model detail) and the level of Information Objects (or the Level of Information Detail). The concept of Building Lifecycle Stages (BLS) has existed for numerous decades and is used in standards and regulations, such as RIBA, HOAI, etc. This concept aims to break down the activities required to design, construct, commission, and operate a building and to allocate sets of activities to well-defined roles or stakeholders involved in the BLS. Deliverable D3.3 of the BIM4EEB project aims to extend the above mentioned open meta-data building model of the AECO-domain with features aiming to support the management of LOD over the various stages of the BLS corresponding to renovation process modelling. This shall be achieved through the development of an ontology framework that is part of a larger modular ontology platform developed in the BIM4EEB project.</p><p>The discussion starts with a specification of this deliverable in the context of the BIM4EEB project, i.e. oblective, what are the relations to other tasks and deliverables in the BIM4EEB project. This is followed by a state-of-the-art analysis (SOTA) in the area of LOD. Based on this SOTA the authors present an ontological approach for the representation of different LOD systems. In a subsequent chapter, the authors will then discuss requirements for LOD-based BIM-data representation, i.e. we clearly distinguish between the "building objects" which usually exist over multiple BLS and data specifying the "building objects" which might be distinct over the different BLS and thus evolve over those LODs. Based on the analysis, the ontology approach is further extended to address these requirements and enable to represent information in multiple levels of detail.</p><p>Furthermore, a representational schema comprised of various components in renovation workflow is developed. These components are LOD, BLS, BIM data, renovation activities, stakeholders and use cases. Along with the renovation component description, the representational schema also defines the relationship between these components corresponding to the renovation workflow. The ontology approach is further extended to represent these components and their interrelations. The final output of this deliverable is a Digital Construction Lifecycle (DICL) ontology to represent BIM data in different levels of detail corresponding to renovation workflow. Finally, D3.3 briefly discusses aspects of developed ontology management and also presents a simple demonstration example. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PUBLISHING SUMMARY</head><p>Deliverable D3.3 focuses on BIM data representation in different Levels of Detail (LOD) corresponding to the renovation process modelling. The modelling approach in this deliverable corresponds to the renovation workflow processes specified in Task T 2.1 of BIM4EEB. It aims to address the current deficit in specifying the varying scope and detail of product models over the different lifecycle stages. This difference of scope and detail results from the various information requirements of the distinct stakeholders being actively involved in the several building lifecycle phases.</p><p>The development goal is a Digital Construction Lifecycle (DICL) ontology which describes the different activities, tasks, and sequences and their interrelations to stakeholders involved and the information required. The DICL ontology is linked to other BIM4EEB ontologies (D3. <ref type="bibr">2 and D3.4)</ref> to support the representation of BIM data in different Levels of Detail.</p><p>The DICL ontology proposed will become a part of the BIM4EEB modular ontology framework (D3.6). It establishes an effective and transparent instrument for the classification and analysis of product and process data related to LOD and BLS corresponding to roles and stakeholders <ref type="bibr">(designers, architects, vendors, contractors, workers, occupants)</ref>, including their capabilities and responsibilities to manage and maintain LOD-data. Additionally, the instruments provided will support the establishment of standardised collaboration protocols between stakeholders, uninterrupted communication flows and sharing of relevant data and information represented in BIM models when required.</p><p>The proposed approach will allow for modular, incrementally adaptable, efficient, customised data-sharing features and thus the provision of high-value applications and tools, not only towards optimising design and decision-making but also for increasing the effectiveness of on-site works. This task will deliver an ontology for BIM data representation on different levels of development corresponding to renovation process modelling (D3.3).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">BIM4EEB Context</head><p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an advanced information technology that should be adopted in the AEC industry by relevant stakeholders. These stakeholders are performing their activities with the use of BIM models <ref type="bibr">(Karlapudi et al. 2020)</ref>. Throughout Building Lifecycle Stages (BLS) a renovation project has several phases, e.g. early design, initial design, design of documentation, detailed design, before procurement etc. Going through the BLS the BIM model evolves. Early BIM models are broader and focus on interfaces between building and spatial 'objects'. In subsequent steps, the refined models focus on smaller parts but specify those parts and their internal structure in increasing detail and with enriched information content. This information refinement process is specified through the concept of "Levels of Details" (LOD).</p><p>In the context of the BIM4EEB project, this deliverable is dedicated to developing an ontology to represent these data refinements in different LOD corresponding to the renovation process modelling. This ontology also represents the renovation process by describing the involved activities, activity sequences, their interrelations to stakeholders and the required information. For the purpose of ontology definition, some of the defined concepts from the other BIM4EEB ontologies (i.e. from D3.2, D3.4) are used.</p></div>

The table below indicates the identified stages within the Deliverable D2.1.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">Related publications</head><p>A set of scientific papers were published in the peer-reviewed conferences based on the achieved results from this deliverable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Structure of the Document</head><p>The deliverable starts with an introduction that describes the scope and context of the deliverable along with the relation to other deliverables or concepts of the BIM4EEB project. From the task description, this deliverable aimed to develop an ontology to represent the BIM data in different LODs corresponding to renovation process modelling.</p><p>To achieve this deliverable object, it is important to understand the structure and framework of LOD systems. So the chapter 2 of this deliverable focused on the state-of-the-art analysis of LOD systems or standards. This comprehensive understanding further helps to develop the ontology representation of LOD systems which is the clear focus of chapter 3. Along with the ontology-based representation of LOD systems, chapter 3 also provides a clear explanation of the developed ontology representation through the example demonstration and verification.</p><p>Another important task in the deliverable is to link this LOD system to the BIM data represented through ontologies. For this purpose, an investigation on different possibilities and requirements for LOD-based BIM data representation is carried. Based on the analysis and project requirements a flexible methodology called "objectification of properties" is considered to represent the BIM data in different levels of detail. Chapter 4 illustrates this development along with clear explanations.</p><p>The further development of this deliverable is the renovation process ontology which aimed to represent the renovation activities, their sequences and the involved stakeholders. This renovation process ontology also should be linked to the ontologies representing the information requirements in different LODs. To achieve this goal, in Chapter 5, an analysis is conducted on the defined renovation workflow in Deliverable D2.1. Based on this analysis results, an ontology representation is developed to indicate the renovation processes and link them to the BIM data represented in different levels of detail. The emphasis on renovation process modelling provides a potential link to subsequent work in Task 3.4 of WP3, BIM4EEB.</p><p>With these developments, the major tasks are achieved and successfully document in this deliverable. In addition to the developments, chapter 6 provides information on the management of the developed ontologies. Finally, chapter 7 draws conclusions on the developed and demonstrated work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Components for analysis</head><p>The components listed below specify the scope of our work and introduce major concepts for the modelling activities in Task 3.3. These components further guides the work in T3.3 and supports the development of the Digital Construction Lifecycle Ontology (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>).</p><p>• LOD for required BIM data. This is a modelling approach representing the evolution of data in BIM.</p><p>• Stakeholders acting in renovation processes -∑38 were selected and explained in D2.1 (see also Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">2</ref>). In this report, we distinguish stakeholders as: o Information Provider: These are stakeholders collecting, compiling, creating information/data to be further used by Information Processor(s). o Information Processor: These are stakeholders receiving, retrieving, changing, analysing the information before transferring it to other stakeholders acting as Information Consumers. o Information Consumer: These are stakeholders receiving and consuming the information.</p><p>• BIM-objects. These are modelled in IFC as classes with corresponding properties or sets of properties. BIM-objects are used to model building products and processes. • Building Lifecycle Stages (BLS): This is a modelling approach to break down the processes to design, construct, operate, or demolish a building. BLS are closely related to rules and regulations.</p><p>• Activities: This is a modelling approach to represent dedicated actions and groups of them (processes) which are executed by distinct stakeholders to design, construct, operate, or demolish a building. 196 activities related to building renovation are outlined by D2.1. • Use Cases: This is an approach supporting the dynamic combination of Activities. Three Use Cases are proposed in this deliverable. The above Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref> is reflecting those six components/domains to be considered for the definition of the "Digital Construction Lifecycle (DICL)" ontology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">DICL ontology introduction</head><p>This section provides an initial introduction to the ontology developed as a part of task 3.3. The table below describes details on developed DICL ontology regarding the repository, namespace convention, etc.  Within this deliverable, the Ontology Visual Notations from (Garijo and Poveda-Villalón 2020) are adopted to represent the DICL ontology. This representation is performed in two different phases. In the introduction phase, only the taxonomy of ontology structure corresponding to Classes and Data properties is represented (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> overleaf).</p><p>Later in the development phase, the representation is elaborated regarding the relations between the classes using object properties based on the investigated requirements. In the development process of DICL ontology, the classes from the other BIM4EEB workflow ontologies are also used. The major motivation is to reduce the redundancy and repetition of ontology concepts within the BIM4EEB onology suite.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Major updates compared to previous version</head><p>A list of major updates addressed in this deliverable when compared to the previous version (version 2.2) is presented below.</p><p>• Extended the discussion related to competency questions • Readjusting the subheadings for chapters 3, 4 and 5 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>State-of-art analysis on LOD</head><p>The abbreviation "LOD" is used in various meanings. When writing the proposal, we were strongly influenced by the LOD-definition of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), which is commonly known as "The LOD framework for the Building Information Modelling Protocol Form" (AIA Contract Documents 2013). In this case, the term LOD refers to the "Level of Development" required for BIM-model elements' content. The term "Level of Development" is used rather than "Level of Detail" in recognition of the fact that a visually very detailed element might in fact be generic and despite appearances might be at a low level of design development (BIM Wiki 2020).</p><p>The LOD levels of BIM data should be generally defined for different stages of projects when data sharing takes place. This is a pragmatic approach to refer to the granularity of BIM data and to track the data refinements throughout the project progression over multiple stages of the building. Furthermore, this would allow stakeholders to verify that project information is detailed enough to meet their requirements, enabling them to decide whether to proceed to the next project stage or not <ref type="bibr">(Karlapudi et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Commencing in 2004, different countries have developed different LOD standards generating a complex situation at an international level. A single, unified approach for the definition of LOD is pending. The abbreviation "LOD" is used in various meanings in different countries, such as the USA -BIMForum Specification (BIMFORUM), UK -BS 1192-1 and PAS 1192-2, 3 (PAS 1192-2) (PAS 1192-3), and Italy UNI 11337 part 4 (UNI 11337-4) (see also Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref>).</p><p>An analysis of various LOD systems according to the standard of practices or national norms is carried out as a part of the initial study. Based on the results from this analysis a conclusion is drawn on flexible usage of these frameworks into the construction project irrespective of standards and the region of work.</p><p>It also identified the basic requirement that needs to be addressed in the ontology representation of the LOD frameworks or systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">LOD Definition in European Standards</head><p>An initial analysis of LOD had been carried out in Task 3.1 (see Deliverables D3.1 section "3.4 Evolution of information during execution").</p><p>In this deliverable, we provide a comparison between selected LOD scales referred to in different stages of the project. More specifically, we illustrate the different LOD framework definitions from the following standards based on national or regional specifications:</p><p>-Italian -UNI 11337 in its part 4 (UNI 11337-4), -EN 17412:2019: "BIM -Level of Information Need -Concepts and principles -UK -PAS 1192-2 (PAS 1192-2:2013) and <ref type="bibr">3 (PAS 1192</ref><ref type="bibr">-3:2014</ref><ref type="bibr">), -EN 19650 (BS EN ISO 19650-1, 2018)</ref> A relevant standard under development from WG2 of CEN/TC 442 is EN 17412:2019: "Building Information Modelling -Level of Information Need -Concepts and principles" (BS EN 17412-1:2020). This document specifies the methodology to describe the Levels of Definitions of BIM deliveries throughout the lifecycle of built assets, and in particular how the Level of Information is related to the different BIM usages.</p><p>It clarifies how far a common European definition can be agreed upon and when further detailing must occur within each member state. (BS EN 17412-1:2020) defines two terms used:</p><p>• LOG: Level of Geometry, and LOI: Level of Information. This is to describe the state of the definition of Model Elements (ME) in Building Information Models. It establishes a common way to label the different levels, here, in particular, the Levels of Geometry and Levels of Information, according to a naming scheme, such as numeric as 1-5, or 100-500, or alphanumeric, such as A-E, or by a combination of both.</p><p>The recently published <ref type="bibr">standard EN 19650 (BS EN ISO 19650-1, 2018)</ref>, which was developed on the Page 20 Public basis of the British national standard BS 1192-2 "Specification for information management for the capital/delivery phase of construction projects using building information modelling" (PAS 1192-2, 2013) introduces LoD as "Level of Definition".</p><p>To make the case even more confusing, it provides the following "formula": LoD = LOD + LOI.</p><p>The meaning of this "formula" is, that the Level of Definition comprises of two components, such:</p><p>• Levels of model Detail (LOD), which relates to the graphical content of models;</p><p>• Levels of model Information (LOI), which relates to the non-graphical content of models.</p><p>The levels of model detail and model information are generally defined for key stages of a project at which "data drops" (information exchanges) take place, allowing stakeholders to verify that project information is consistent with their requirements and enabling them to decide whether to proceed to the next stage.</p><p>However, at present, there is no standardised definition for the timing of data drops or for levels of model detail and model information, other than the suggestion that they should be aligned to stakeholders' decision points and should be consistent across all appointments. This is because it is thought they will vary depending on the nature of the project. However, some very broad guidance on how to define data drops was given in <ref type="bibr">(PAS 1192</ref><ref type="bibr">(PAS -2, 2013))</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref> provides an initial comparison between three available standards, such as the Italian -UNI 11337-4, EN 17412:2019 and the US-based definition of LOD, published and maintained by the BIM-Forum with major contributions from AIA and the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC).</p><p>EN 19650 was not explicitly included in the table, since it uses definitions that are comparable to those provided in EN 17412:2019. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">LOD Definitions in International Standards</head><p>The BIM-Forum provides the following background information on their webpage:  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">6</ref> (below). One clear benefit of these definitions is an evaluation of the scope and quality of information; e.g. by saying "Any information derived from LOD 100 elements must be considered approximate." </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">"</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LOD 200</head><p>Generic system object or assembly -graphic representation (non-graphic information may be attached) with approximate quantities, size, shape, location and orientation. They may be recognizable as the components they represent, or they may be volumes for space reservation. Any information derived from LOD 200 elements must be considered approximate.</p><p>LOD 300</p><p>LOD 200 + System or Components -graphic representation (non-graphic information may be attached) with specific quantities, size, shape, location, orientation can be measured directly from the model without referring to non-modelled information such as notes or dimension callouts.</p><p>LOD 350</p><p>LOD 300 + Interfaces with other building systems added. Parts necessary for coordination of the element with nearby or attached elements are modelled. These parts will include such items as supports and connections.</p><p>LOD 400</p><p>LOD 350 + Information added -for detailing, fabrication, assembly and installation.</p><p>A LOD 400 element is modelled at sufficient detail and accuracy for the fabrication of the represented component.</p><p>LOD 500</p><p>Field-verified representation in terms of size, shape, location, quantity, and orientation. It is not an indication of progression to a higher level of model element geometry or non-graphic information (which may also be attached to the Model Elements). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Flexible Usage and Adaptability</head><p>When using the LOD approach, it is necessary to highlight that this should be used as a methodological approach that can be adjusted and modified to different national constraints. The approach we take is defining the reasonable number of different levels of detail to specify what should be included for our purposes (e.g. building renovation), and amalgamating the information content (concerning geometrical and alpha-numerical data) in one commonly specified, holistic definition. This methodological approach is valid, irrespectively in what country a certain standardised solution applies. This allows us to provide a 'robust framework' as a solid foundation for LOD-ontology development.</p><p>Furthermore, the clarification should be made that LOD's relate to Model Elements and not complete Building Information Models. Furthermore, on the attribute level, one must be sure that the name of the attribute like "height" or "length" is always correctly interpreted in the ontology. This is usually achieved through alignments (see Deliverable D3.6).</p><p>To maintain the general applicability, it should always be possible to change the LOD scale in the LOD ontological structure with additional mapping represented by the abovementioned (BS EN 17412-1:2020).</p><p>As an outcome, it will be possible to outline a subset of parameters in form of LOD-related matrixes that will satisfy data exchange requirements during selected stakeholders' activities.</p><p>With this knowledge on different LOD standards, scales and their relations, we move to further investigation of the necessary requirements for the ontological representation of a LOD structure. The following sub-section aims to describe these requirements along with the possible options to develop a common ontological representation of LOD systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Requirements for ontologies to support LOD systems</head><p>In the area of information management, the support for LODs centres around the challenge to represent:</p><p>(1) various LOD systems,</p><p>(2) multiple versions of information about the same object and</p><p>(3) the connections of LOD-specific data to building lifecycle processes.</p><p>A proper representation not only allows the users to access and work inside one specific LOD but enable various cross-LOD functions:</p><p>• to access the history of values,</p><p>• to utilize the links, annotations, and other enrichments of previous LOD objects with those in subsequent LODs,</p><p>• to check the consistency and possible deviations between objects at different LODs, and</p><p>• to determine what kinds of adjustments to previous LOD models would be needed.</p><p>Moreover, it helps to connect LODs to other aspects of building information: to keep track of the origin of information and to maintain the rules for validating it against the requirements of subsequent activities. This analysis of LOD requirements suggests at least the following areas where ontology definitions are needed to properly support LODs:</p><p>• LOD frameworks: The representation of various levels, their relations, and the links to associated definitions.</p><p>• LOD sensitive BIM data: The representation of (versioned) properties of objects to capture the data at multiple different levels in an organized manner.</p><p>• Connection of the LOD framework to processes. Ontology-based LOD representation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">LOD -Ontology representation</head><p>The analysis of various LOD systems leads to different implementation requirements which need to be defined by the ontology-based frameworks. The concept of Competency Questions (CQ) is used to describe such requirements in terms of natural language questions. These CQs are used as the basis for the development of an ontology structure, concepts and properties. The development of an ontology framework for LOD representation is progressed towards providing all the answers for these competency questions.</p><p>• CQ1: How can the BIM data representation be adjusted or modified to different LOD systems?</p><p>From the general analysis of different LOD systems, an ontology schema is developed and illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref>. Since different renovation projects can adopt different LOD systems, the developed ontological structure of the LODs can accommodate the different standards of representations as detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref>.</p><p>The methodological approach is to represent LOD systems and their levels as classes, which can then be instantiated on a project-to-project basis. The class dicl:LODFramework can be instantiated with the frameworks (e.g. BIMForum, UK LOD, Italian LOD). The levels in the different frameworks are added as instances to the class dicl:LODLevel. These instances are subsequently assigned to BIM data and modified based on the project requirements. • CQ2: What is the link between the LOD system and its levels?</p><p>As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref>, each LOD system has several levels or scales which are classified majorly based on their purpose and the level of intent. For example, the UK and European systems classify their levels towards the representation of Graphical (Model) objects and Information objects. Instead, the USA system classifies their levels based on As Designed and As-Built information.</p><p>In the present approach, all these Classification-Levels and as well the scale of the LOD system are Page 25 Public considered as Levels for the respective LOD system. To achieve this object, at first instance, the link between the LOD system and its respective Classification-Levels are generated using the object property dicl:hasLevel and its inverse property dicl:isLevelOf. Furthermore, a sub-property chain axiom (dicl:hasLevel o dicl:hasSubLevel → dicl:hasLevel) is assigned to the object property dicl:hasLevel to define semantic interpretation between the LOD scales and LOD Systems. This axiom inherits the new relation by saying LOD scales are defined as levels to the respective LOD system. Please refer to Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> for more understanding on defined and inherited relationships.</p><p>• CQ3: What is the relation between the LOD Classification-Level and the LOD scale? (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref>).</p><p>Within the present approach, a sublevel relationship is generated between the LOD Classification-Level and its respective scale. The implementation idea is that the developed approach should fit into different classification criteria's available now or will be developed in future. This relationship is indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref> using the transitive object property dicl:hasSubLevel and its inverse property dicl:hasSuperLevel.</p><p>• CQ4: What is the relation between LOD scales?</p><p>According to the several LOD systems or frameworks, the level of growth in LOD levels is clearly based on the information growth or refinement. The same idea is considered in the generation of relationships between the levels of a LOD framework and the same is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref> using the transitive object property dicl:hasNextLevel and its inverse property dicl:hasPreviousLevel. A property characteristic called owl:TransitiveProperty is defined for these properties in order to represent the aggregation relationship between levels.</p><p>Apart from the development, an exemplary demonstration is presented in the below subsection to elaborate on the applicability and functionalities of the developed ontology framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">LOD -Demonstration</head><p>For the demonstration, the BIMForum LOD framework is considered. The demonstration uses data from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref> and is represented according to the developed ontology structure which is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref>.</p><p>As represented in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the instances diclvl:AsDesigned and diclvl:AsBuilt are assigned as levels to the instance diclvl:USA_BIMForum using dicl:hasLevel object property. Since this object property's domain and range (dicl:hasLevel) are fixed to the classes dicl:LODFramework and dicl:LODLevel respectively, the inferencing engine automatically develops new knowledge by concluding the instance diclvl:USA_BIMForum belongs to the class dicl:LODFramework and the other instances are belonging to the class dicl:LODLevel. These defined and inherited relationships are clearly separated and illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> by using seperate visualization diagrams.</p><p>Similarly, for other LOD systems, division of a level scale into different LOD Classification-Levels is also possible according to the developed framework. For instance, the UK LOD framework contains Level of Detail (LOD) for geometric information and Level of Information (LOI) for non-geometric information. They basically form two parallel sequences of levels.</p><p>Furthermore, the relationship between the neighbour instances diclvl:AsDesigned and diclvl:AsBuilt is assigned using dicl:hasNextLevel as a transitive object property. As defined in the ontology framework, the dicl:hasNextLevel object property has an inverse relationship assigned with dicl:hasPreviousLevel. This inherited knowledge (inverse relationship) is also represented in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>The LOD scale information regarding each LOD Classification Level is defined by using the transverse object property called dicl:hasSubLevel and its inverse property dicl:hasSuperLevel. Because of the transverse nature of these object properties, any further sub-level of a LOD scale is also considered as a LOD level. Similarly, due to the defined axiom to dicl:hasLevel property, all these LOD scales are inferred as Levels (dicl:LODLevel) to the dicl:LODFramework (diclvl:USA_BIMForum).  The relationship between the LOD levels is modelled by using transitive object property dicl:hasNextLevel (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) according to their role in information growth representation. In addition to this defined relation between adjacent levels, dicl:hasNextLevel and dicl:hasPreviousStage relationships are generated between the non-adjacent levels, for example, between diclvl:LOD_350 and diclvl:LOD_500. These relationships are generated because of the transitive property characteristic of dicl:hasNextstage and dicl:hasPreviousStage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">LOD -Verification</head><p>The verification of the developed ontology framework is performed by running SPARQL queries on the demonstrated example. These queries are majorly developed by considering the competency questions used for the ontology development process. The information related to instances and relations between them is populated to the developed ontology framework based on the analysis results comprised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref>.</p><p>After the population of instances, a reasoner (Pellet) was used to inference the new knowledge and to check the consistency and correctness of the developed ontology. One example query along with the results are illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">7</ref> and further examples are provided in Annex 1, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">14</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LOD-based BIM data Management</head><p>The section provides an analysis for the management of LOD-based BIM data. This analysis focuses on LOD-based representational methods for BIM data (also called LOD sensitive BIM). It also aims to describe the sources of this BIM data generation and the representation of their evolution and refinement. The analysis also considers the developed workflow ontologies (see D3.4) and the other BIM4EEB ontologies developed as part of Deliverable D3.2 (Material, Energy, Occupancy, etc.). The task mainly uses the classes and concepts from ontologies already developed in WP3 and introduces a LOD-based BIM data management workflow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Approach Analysis</head><p>The representation of BIM data in a LOD-sensitive manner is based on the following approach:</p><p>(1) Identifiers (URIs) of entities are not LOD sensitive, and</p><p>(2) The statements about objects can be LOD sensitive.</p><p>That is, objects themselves are not associated with a specific LOD level but their property values can be.</p><p>It is therefore not possible to ask which LOD an object belongs to because the object can simultaneously have properties belonging to many different LOD levels.</p><p>The representation of multiple LOD specific values requires an extended mapping (object, property, level  value) instead of normal mapping provided by RDF triples (object, property  value).</p><p>Such mapping can be implemented in different ways in RDF as reviewed in the Deliverable 3.1 (BIM4EEB-D3.1, 2022). The approaches can be divided into static ones that support a fixed set of levels -such as context-specific properties (e.g., :planned_&lt;property&gt;, :actual &lt;property&gt;), or context-specific namespaces (e.g., planned:&lt;property&gt;, actual:&lt;property&gt;) -and dynamic ones that support a variables set of levels -such as objectified properties (related to RDF reification), singleton properties, and named graphs.</p><p>Since the Digital Construction Lifecycle ontology (DICL) should support different LOD systems (for instance, as used in different countries) and even systems that contain an unspecified number of levels (such as the LOIN standard), only the dynamic approaches can reasonably be considered for a generic ontology. Of these, the most established ones are named graphs and objectified properties.</p><p>Representations to support both of these approaches have been implemented in Digital Construction Ontologies and below their roles in the representation of LOD data is described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Named Graphs</head><p>An RDF database can contain multiple repositories, each of whose contents is an RDF Dataset. An RDF Dataset is a set of RDF graphs, comprised of one default graph and an unlimited number of named graphs.</p><p>Each named graph is identified by its own URI. The possibility to store and use data from multiple different graphs creates an additional dimension to RDF. Instead of triples, the statements are in reality represented as quads in the form &lt;graph, subject, predicate, object&gt; (BIM4EEB 2021, D3.1). It is easy to see how the extended mapping mentioned above can be implemented with quads.</p><p>Named graphs can have properties of their own -that is, triples whose subject is the URI of the named graph. These properties can describe the named graph itself and the dataset contained in the named graph, e.g. the origin, creation time, maximum LOD level, and so on. They can be regarded as metadata of the contained data. Named graphs are an efficient mechanism to represent the metadata that is same for all the contained data. However, when the different triples in the dataset have different metadata, named graphs is not an appropriate representational mechanism.</p><p>Named  The implementation of the levels based on DICV is illustrated in blue color in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">7</ref>. As can be seen, the approach used in Levels 2 and 3 makes it possible to add an unlimited number of additional attributes for each property (such as unit or quantity kind) and each property state (such as LODs, sources, time stamps, and so on). These capabilities would allow a complex LOD-sensitive representation of BIM data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Adopted approach -conclusion</head><p>In the technical sense, the two mechanisms presented -named graphs and objectification of propertiesare not in any conflict with each other. Named graphs works at the level of datasets (e.g., BIM models) and the property objectification at the level of individual datums in the dataset. It is thus technically possible to use them together and combine their strengths.</p><p>The approach adopted in BIM4EEB is based on the established practice that one BIM model can contain information at several different LOD levels. That is, all information in a model is not necessarily at the same LOD level. To capture these intra-model LOD distinctions, it is necessary to use objectified properties. However, at the more coarse level there can be different versions of models -perhaps documenting the situation at specific milestones or capturing a major revision, made necessary by a large design change. These major versions can be managed as different datasets.</p><p>In summary, major dataset-level revisions of BIM models are managed with named graphs through the information containers (dici:BuildingInformationModel) managed in the project information model (dici:ProjectInformationModel) and the actual management of LOD levels inside each of these models is addressed with objectified properties (dicv:Property, dicv:PropertyState). And the subsequent discussion will thus elaborate that approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Ontological representation</head><p>The ontology development process also progresses through addressing the fulfilment of requirements represented in natural language Competency Questions.</p><p>• CQ5: How is the BIM object is represented?</p><p>In the DICL ontology, the class dice:BuildingObject is used to represent the building object information. This class is related to the class dicv:Subject by an equivalent property.</p><p>• CQ6: How to represent multiple versions of information about the same object?</p><p>As clearly elaborated in the above section, an approach called Objectification of Properties is considered to represent the multiple versions of the same object's information. According to this approach, the defined classes dicv:Property and dicv:PropertyState make it possible to add an ultimate number of properties to building objects and their growth of accuracy throughout the project life-cycle. In detail, the object property ). This property definition capabilities are attached to the building object using the object property dicv:hasProperty and its inverse property dicv:isPropertyOf. Once information objects are finished or new updates in information systems have been made, the relevant data can be converted into an RDF form and published as Linked Data to allow the integration of the relevant content with other renovation data. Each information object (explicitly or implicitly) provides information at certain LOD levels, and therefore the data should primarily be converted in a LOD sensitive manner. A difficulty that needs to be taken into account in such conversions is that the LOD frameworks currently used explicitly allow the same BIM model to contain data at different levels of detail. For instance, a structural model can contain a detailed design (e.g., at LOD400) of only one representative element of each type, while the other elements remain at the previous level of LOD (e.g., LOD350).</p><p>Within the DICL ontology development, this can be achieved by using the same approach called Objectification of the properties. This approach or specification also supports the modelling of explicit relationship between LOD and BIM attributes by using the object property dicl:hasLODLevel and its respective inverse property dicl:isLODLevelOf. This relationship makes it possible to represent the property value at its corresponding LOD level. Further relations between the LOD levels and their LOD structure are defined in the ontology representation detailed in Section 3 of this deliverable.</p><p>• CQ8: What are the sources for LOD data?</p><p>Along with the representation of LOD-sensitive BIM data, it is also necessary to represent the sources for this LOD data. The possible sources of LOD data are different kinds of information objects. In the context of BIM4EEB, these are primarily BIM models but can also include drawings, documents, messages and events/notifications. To address this requirement, a concept called dici:informationContainer is considered and liked to dicv:Property and dicv:PropertyState using the object property dicl:isDerivedFrom. This information container represents different data models, drawings, reports, etc. The developed ontology approach is similar to the (Bonduel 2018) approach but a modification is considered to fulfil the needs of deliverable D3.3. which is the representation of LOD level as an owl:instanceOf dicl:LODLevel instead of the data property. This methodology allows users to directly represent the information with already defined levels, which are already categorized based on the LOD systems and contains relationships among the levels. This representation enables the data upgradations and query process much easier and reliable. Mostly eliminated human interpretation and textual errors in the data management process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renovation Process Modelling</head><p>The objective of this section is to develop an ontology representation for renovation process modelling which clearly describes the different activities, sequences, their interrelation with stakeholders involved and information requirements. Along with the ontology developments, the integration of the LOD-based BIM data representation in the renovation process modelling is also specified in this section. This integration mainly focuses on the reduction of the current gap between the process models and the developed BIM models. This integration task doesn't mainly depend on the development of a new ontology framework but to develop a set of required properties to indicate and manage LOD-based BIM data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Renovation components</head><p>To achieve the objective, it is necessary to understand how the renovation workflow is implemented as part of the BIM4EEB project. A comprehensive analysis of the renovation workflow is presented in the deliverable D2.1 of Work Package 2. This section aimed to rewind the involved components in the renovation process described in D2.1. This process helps to understand the relation between these renovation components and supports ontology development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Renovation activities</head><p>Activity is a task need to be carried out by a stakeholder or agent at a specific point of the renovation intervention. All these activities are listed as different renovation processes involved in the corresponding Building Lifecycle Stage (BLS). Approximately, 196 of such well-defined renovation activities are listed and explained in the deliverable D2.1, chapters 3 and 4, Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">4-26</ref>. This complete workflow is majorly considered for the development of ontological representation for renovation processes. But due to confidentiality reasons, non of these activities are revealed in this deliverable. We agreed to denote these activities with dedicated numberings already assigned by D2.1 authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Stakeholders or agents</head><p>Stakeholders or the agents are the actors, who are involved in renovation activities. A sum of 38 stakeholders are represented in D2.1 and all are listed in also Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">2</ref> of this deliverable. An analysis is performed on these stakeholders and their involvement in the activities categorized by the BLS. According to the defined set of renovation workflows (From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref> to 26 in D2.1), a relational based representation is generated between the Agents (stakeholders), Activities and Building lifecycle stages. This relationship is clearly indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">9</ref> and/or Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_47">25</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">9</ref>, these activities are represented with their respective numbering (red colour) and their representation in specific BLS is also denoted with numbering (Blue colour). For more information on BLS numbering, please refer to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Activity sequence</head><p>According to Deliverable D2.1, the structure of the renovation processes are defined completely based on the BLS following the EN 16310. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">9</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">8</ref> is also illustrating the same information. The details  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref> to 26 in D2.1. Similar to these definitions, to indicate the sequential appearance of activities, this deliverable also uses the BLS as a renovation activity categorization factor. Furthermore, developments in this process are presented in Section 5.4 of this deliverable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4">Usecase</head><p>In this step, a set of simple use cases are defined with the aim of BIM4EEB tool requirements according to the renovation workflow described in D2.1. The idea of this implementation is to understand the involvement of various components (BLS, stakeholders, activities, etc,) and their relationship in the renovation process. We try to understand how do these components are used or at least related to other work package developments in future. Also, try to understand how does the development of DICL ontology should support domain-based process representations. With these use cases, we got a better understanding of the renovation process and used them as initial steps for the DICL ontology development process. We have outlined the three Use Cases as a dynamic combination of selected activities performed by related stakeholders during the renovation processes in the focus of the BIM4EEB. One is presented below and the remaining two are in Annex IV -Additional Use Case Definitions.</p><p>Use Case 1: Data Acquisition for HVAC Design, Operation and Efficiency Management This use case describes activities related to data acquisition processes. All the identified activities may help in the development of digital tools for fast mapping of existing building data. The identified activities majorly provide the information regarding geometrical data, existing services systems, presently available heating and water pipes, ventilation systems, electrical cords, equipment, etc. Here, the numbers within the below table referring the activity numbers mentioned in renovation workflow developed in D2.1. The numbers used to represent BLS is completely based on the BLS numbering illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">1</ref>. However, we extended this analysis to the usecases defined in deliverable D3.1. The results from this analysis is presented below. The use cases defined in Deliverable 3.1 (Appendix I) are also related to the process steps (renovation activities) identified in Deliverable 2.1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref> to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">12</ref>) and the LOD levels are related with each other. The information contents developed in the use cases are also indicated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Representational Schema</head><p>Efficient management, collaboration and sharing of object information throughout the BLS and among stakeholders are fundamental to ensure the successful implementation of a project <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mangialardi et al. 2017)</ref>. The management of a project's lifecycle information ensures the reduction of error-prone operations, data communication problems, and provides significant efficiency benefits, time-saving, etc. (Di <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Biccari et al. 2018)</ref>. The major components involved in the renovation lifecycle data management are BLS, Activities within BLS, stakeholders, Level of detail, product data and use-case based exchange requirements. The optimized modelling of these components can enhance the collaboration benefits through the effective and iterative exchange of information <ref type="bibr">(Karlapudi et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the analysis of renovation components, renovation workflow and LOD-based BIM data  Similarly, the Process representation describes the role of different stakeholders involved in renovation activities listed in various Building Lifecycle Stages. The relationship between these components is already analysed and represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">9</ref>. Further explanations regarding the ontology development process are comprehensively elaborated within the coming section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Ontological representation of renovation workflow</head><p>The work involved in this section is to develop an ontological representation of renovation processes and link it to the LOD-based BIM data. Similar to the above sections, the concept of CQs is used for requirements specification for renovation process ontology development. The ontology development process progresses through addressing these requirements or CQs.  • CQ10: How to identify the sequence of activities?</p><p>As described in D2.1, renovation workflow, the sequential relationship between these activities are represented based on the BLS. In the renovation workflow, the activities are divided or categorized completely based on the structure of BLS. In technical terms, the progressive growth of renovation interventions can easily be represented or tracked through the BLS. Also, the relation between these different stages can easily be represented in ontology structure. Based on these advantages, in DICL ontology, the same BLS concept is adopted to represent the sequence of renovation activities.</p><p>Furthermore, the comprehensive and elaborated explanations regarding the ontological representation of BLS frameworks are presented in Section 5.4 of this deliverable.</p><p>• CQ11: How are the stakeholders or agents related to activities?</p><p>An intensive analysis of the relationship between the agents and activities are already presented in subsection 5.1.2 of this deliverable. Based on these analyses, In the DICl ontology, the class dica:Agent is adopted to specify all the actors/stakeholders involved in the building renovation process. Also, a class dice:Role is adopted in DICL ontology to assign the role to an agent based on their involvement in the specific activity. As represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">11</ref>, the list of identified roles for the agents are instances of the class dice:Role. These specific roles are assigned to agents through the object property dice:hasRole and its inverse property dice:isRoleOf.</p><p>Apart from the representation of the relationship between the activities and the stakeholders, an analysis is carried on the participating role of the stakeholders in each activity. This analysis was carried out based on the defined workflows in Deliverable D2.1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">4 to 26</ref>). These analysis results are represented in tabular format in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">12</ref>   Similarly, a simple relationship is defined between activity and the agent by using the object property dica:hasAgent and its respective inverse property dica:isAgentIn. Furthermore, the object property dica:isAgentIn is categorized into three sub-properties dicl:consumesFrom, dicl:providesTo and dicl:processFrom, which are used based on the role of the agent.</p><p>• CQ12: How does the renovation process linked to BIM data represented in LOD-sensitive manner?</p><p>As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">10</ref>, the connection of LODs to renovation processes is generated based on the information requirements (BIM data). For example, different activities require specific information regarding the building objects available at a needed level of detail (LOD). In this DICL ontological framework, an explicit mapping methodology is specified to represent these requirements. This methodology specifies the following information for each activity.</p><p>• Object (dice:BuildingObject);</p><p>• Property name (or a property set or other grouping of properties);</p><p>• Nature of data needed (e.g., a LOD level or other specification).</p><p>A difficult representational challenge is how to represent the values of the same properties of objects at multiple different levels. The most typical approach is to use the objectification of properties, which was explained in Section 4.1. By using this approach, an ontological representation of LOD-based BIM data on the attribute or property level is achieved and elaborated in Section 4.2.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">11</ref>, this link between activities and LOD-sensitive BIM data is indicated by using the object property dicp:hasObject and its inverse property dicp:isObjectIn. This relationship allows inheriting the required level of data for each renovation activity within the building lifecycle stages.</p><p>• CQ13: How to represent specific use cases within the renovation workflow?</p><p>Atomic activities can be grouped forming larger processes or even use cases. Thus Use Cases can be defined as a special type of activity. The specification of Use Cases may help to simplify navigation through the knowledge space. It also provides an instrument to provide access to information requirements of specific tools or domain-specific processes involved in the renovation process. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">13</ref> shows, how activities that were defined in D2.1 are grouped into larger activities called Use Cases. Concerning the DICL ontology (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">11</ref>), this grouping mechanism is represented within the ontology by a class dicl:InformationalUsecase. The involved activities (dice:Activity) within this use case are represented by using an object property called dicl:hasRepresents and its inverse property dicl:isRepresentedIn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Building Lifecycle Stages (BLS)</head><p>In common practice, activities are classified according to BLS. Deliverable D2.1 provides an extensive analysis of activities for building renovation in each Building Lifecycle Stage. The relationship between BLS and the Activities is represented in the DICL ontology framework with the help of object property dicl:hasActivity and its inverse property dicl:isActivityIn. It is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">11</ref>. Also in DICL ontology development process, the Building Lifecycle Stage is considered as a criterion for defining the sequential relationship between the activities through the definition of the relationship between stages.</p><p>However, the activity analysis in Deliverable D2.1 primarily considers BS EN 16310:2013. In practice there exist many other systems or frameworks to represent these lifecycle stages. Thus, the development of the ontological representation for BLS should be capable to accommodate these different specifications. This section aims to investigate alternative BLS representations.  <ref type="bibr">181, 182, 183, 187, 191, 195 178, 184, 185 141, 142, 160, 161 22, 28, (29, 30), 33, 34, 35, 37, 40, 44 17, 18, 19, 27 --3, 4</ref> Use Cases Definition Activities supporting Use Cases 1 -3 <ref type="bibr">189, 192 ---166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 173, 174, 175 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 155, 156, 159</ref>   • CQ15: What is the link between the BLS system and its respective Stages?</p><p>Similar to the various BLS system definition, stages of the respective BLS system are defined as instances to dicl:BLSStage. The relationship between these stages to the BLS system is generated with the help of object property dicl:hasStage and its inverse property dicl:isStageOf.</p><p>As represented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">9</ref>, the stages from BS EN 16310:2013 are represented as main-stages and substages to respective main-stage. The relationship between the main-stage and its respective sub-stages are defined by using the object property dicl:hasSubStage and its inverse property dicl:hasSuperStage.</p><p>To represent the relationship between the BLS system to these sub-stages is generated by using the subProperty chain axiom (dicl:hasStage o dicl:hasSubStage → dicl:hasStage) defined to the object property dicl:hasStage. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">14</ref> is clearly illustrating these relationships along with the defined axioms.</p><p>• CQ16: What is the relation between stages?</p><p>The relationship between the stages are defined by using the object properties called dicl:hasSubStage, dicl:hasNextStage and their respective inverse properties dicl:hasSuperStage, dicl:hasPreviousStage. Similarly, the transitive character of the properties is enabled by assigning owl:TransitiveProperty to these object property which further enables the aggregated relationships between the stages.</p><p>• CQ17: What is the relation between the main-stage to sub-stage of other main-stage?</p><p>The complex part of this ontology development process is to generate the relationship between the mainstage and sub-stages from another main-stage according to the BS EN 16310:2013. For example, as represented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">9</ref>, the human can easily interpret that the sub-stage "Pre-construction" is the next stage after the main-stage "Design". These complex relations are modelled in the ontology by using • CQ18: How to represent the mapping between different BLS systems?</p><p>In DICL ontology, the mapping relationships between the stages from different BLS frameworks are modelled by using the symmetric object property dicl:isRelaventWith.</p><p>To provide a better understanding of this developed approach, an example demonstration is generated for the BLS system -BS EN 16310:2013 and elaborated clearly in the below section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2">Demonstration of ontology approach</head><p>For a clear understanding of the functionality of this ontology framework, a demonstration is considered. For the demonstration, the BLS representations from the standard (BS EN 16310:2013) illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">9</ref> is considered. The list of stages from (BS EN 16310:2013) is represented as main-stages and a couple of sub-stages (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_34">15</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">16</ref>).</p><p>As represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_34">15</ref>, the instances dicstg:Initiative, dicstg:Initiation and dicstg:Design are assigned as stages for the instance dicstg:BS_EN_16310 using dicl:hasStage object property. Since the object property's (dicl:hasStage) domain and range are fixed to the classes dicl:BLSFramework and dicl:BLStage respectively, the inferencing engine automatically develops new knowledge by concluding the instance dicstg:BS_EN_16310 belongs to the class dicl:BLSFramework and the other instances are belonging to the class dicl:BLStage.  Sub-stage information regarding each main-stage is defined by using the transverse object property called dicl:hasSubStage and its inverse property dicl:isSuperStage. Because of the transverse nature of these object properties, further sub-levels of sub-stage are considered as sub-stages to the main-stage. Similarly, due to the defined axiom to dicl:hasStage property, all these sub-stages are inferred as stages (dicl:BLStages) to the dicl:BLSframework (dicstg:BS EN 16310).</p><p>Furthermore, the relationship between the sub-stages of a mainstage is developed by using dicl:hasNextstage. Due to this defined relationship, the inferences relations from its inverse property and the transitive property characteristic are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">16</ref>.</p><p>But the complexity is to infer the relationship between the main-stage (dicstg:Initiative) and a sub-stage (dicstg:ProjectInitiation) of another mainstage (dicstg:Initiation), similarly between the sub-stage (dicstg:BusinessCase) of a mainstage (dicstg:Initiative) and the sub-stage (dicstg:ProjectInitiation) of another mainstage (dicstg:Initiation). This complexity of inferencing the new knowledge is resolved The understanding of the inference relationship between the main stage and the sub-stages of another main stage is pretty straightforward from the assigned axioms but the generated links between sub-stages of different mainstages are quite complex to understand.</p><p>The assigned axiom to dicl:hasNextstage generates the next-stage relationship between dicstg:Initiative and dicstg:ProjectInitiation. It also means that dicstg:Initiative is a previous-stage to dicstg:ProjectInitiation and this information is generated based on the inverse property of dicl:hasNextstage, which is dicl:hasPreviousStage. Now the axioms assigned to dicl:hasPreviousStage further inherits the previous-stage relationship between dicstg:ProjectInitiation and dicstg:BusinessCase. These inherited relationships are clearly represented and distinguished within Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">16</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Conclusion</head><p>The development goal of this deliverable is a Digital Construction Lifecycle (DICL) ontology to represent BIM data in different levels of detail (LOD) corresponding to renovation workflow. Intending to fulfil this objective, the deliverable starts with an extensive analysis of LOD systems defined in different standards or publications. Based on this analysed knowledge, an ontological approach is developed with the idea to accommodate all the LOD systems. The development process is carried out based on the analysed requirements (CQ), which should be fulfilled by the adopted approach. Also to provide a clear understanding of the developed ontological approach for LOD representations, a demonstration example is elaborated based on the USA -BIMForum LOD system. The deliverable also explains the further framework capabilities corresponding to the BIM data management in terms of LOD-sensitive BIM data.</p><p>Furthermore, an analysis is carried on the requirements and needs to be addressed by the DICL ontology corresponding to renovation workflow representation and connection of LOD data to the renovation process. This analysis describes the involved components in renovation workflow concerning activities, tasks, and sequences, their interrelations to stakeholders involved, the required information, other resources, etc. To achieve this objective, the ontological approach is further extended based on the 6dimensional representational schema including Activity, Stakeholder, BLS, LOD, BIM data and Use cases. This schema expresses the relationship between these six dimensions of the building renovation process.</p><p>Based on these investigations and the representational schema, a complete Digital Construction Lifecycle (DICL) ontology is developed and elaborated in the deliverable. The developed DICL ontology is also easily adaptable and applicable to the present BIM process since the representation of BIM data in different ontologies is within reach. The DICL ontology also brings flexibility, compliance and alignment capabilities through logical reasoning and knowledge inferencing in BIM data management. Moreover, the validation and evaluation of the developed DICL ontology were performed based on SPARQL queries. The results from these queries are presented either in the text or in complementing Annexes. With the defined and additional inherited knowledge capabilities, the developed ontology framework evidently presents its applicability and functionalities in terms of modelling BIM data in different LODs corresponding to renovation workflow.</p><p>Finally, the deliverable provides an overview of alignments and further dependencies with both the external and BIM4EEB ontologies. Furthermore, a demonstration example using a populated DICL ontology is presented in Annex V -Basic demonstration of LOD sensitive BIM data. Public</p><p>Here some images are provided related to the example queries above. The objective of these images to compare the query results before and after the inclusive of inferred data.

The list of activities involved in this use case describes the present condition of the systems installed in a building. These activities are also involved in systems' operation and efficiency management in terms of creating execution plans, strategies and systems' enhancement techniques. These activities are also covering tendering, construction and buildings' operation techniques. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Use Case 3: Fast Track Renovation Operation</head><p>The use case consists of those activities allowing to speed up the renovation process by setting up some strategies, basic planning principles and efficient investigation of possibilities. The activities related to costefficient construction planning and schedules. Those activities diverted on awareness of the renovation status are also included in this Use Case. Inspection and monitoring of day-to-day activities in the construction (progress) and checking of their compliance with plans are also the major activities that play an important role in the efficient and fast renovation process.   Each example file contains the information regarding the Polish demo site's 2 nd floor concerning the specified LOD level. Initially, an analysis of the generated BIM models was performed. The analysis results are captured in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">17</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_37">Table 18</ref>. The first table intends to specify the number of instances within the BIM models with different LOD levels. The observations from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">17</ref> clarify the only changes in the material or layer information assigned to the building objects by using IfcRelAssociatesMaterial. • IfcBuilding 1 1</p><p>• IfcBuildingStorey 1 1</p><p>• IfcDoor 17 17</p><p>• IfcOpeningElement 35 35</p><p>• IfcProject 1 1</p><p>• IfcSite 1 1</p><p>• IfcSlab[Floor] 1 1</p><p>• IfcSpace 34 34</p><p>• IfcWall 30 30 • IfcRelAggregates 4 4</p><p>• IfcRelAssignsToGroup 3 3</p><p>• IfcRelAssociatesClassification 2 1</p><p>• IfcRelAssociatesMaterial 76 87</p><p>• IfcRelConnectsPathElements 47 47</p><p>• IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure 1 1</p><p>• IfcRelDefinesByProperties 372 372</p><p>• IfcRelDefinesByType 55 57</p><p>• IfcRelFillsElement 33 33</p><p>• IfcRelVoidsElement 35 35 EntityTypes 5 5</p><p>• IfcDoorStyle 13 13</p><p>• IfcSlabType 1 1</p><p>• IfcSpaceType 34 34</p><p>• IfcWallType 4 4</p><p>• IfcWindowStyle 3 5</p><p>In later stages, for more understanding of the incremental changes in both models, the observations are extended to the level of attributes. For this, a single instance from each entity (mentioned in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">17</ref>) is considered and the results from these observations are illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_37">18</ref>.</p><p>This table represents the gradual increment within the object properties (attributes) along with the increase of Levels of detail. It also observed the growth of the object's construction details (material layers or materials). From this basic analysis of these BIM models, the following scenarios are observed.</p><p>• Scenario 1:-there is no change in the BIM Objects or entities (wall, slab, etc.) but the object property growth is observed along with the increment of LOD levels;</p><p>• Scenario 2:-Observed a growth in BIM object's construction details in terms of Layers and Material information Also, for the development of Digital Construction Lifecycle ontology, these scenarios are considered as development requirements. The following ontology demonstration also provides clear understandings of the developed ontology by addressing the above-mentioned scenarios.  In the Data Conversion process, the received IFC files are converted into respective OWL files using the BIMMS platform. This is an automated conversion process established in the BIMMS platform. So this conversion process is not described within this deliverable.</p><p>The next part of the demonstration describes the population of data from the BIM models (OWL files) to DICL ontology.</p><p>The last part explores the filtering of data using LOD levels. This demonstration work has been carried out with the help of the SPARQL queries. Detailed discussions concerning the workflow along with the query profiles are provided in the subsequent sections. Due to the high amount of data, the documentation of the demonstration is restricted to Wall Objects (wall entities) but the workflow is valid for the entire BIM model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.1.1">Populating the DICL ontology</head><p>The population of already available information from BIM models to the required BIM4EEB ontologies is the major task in the complete demonstration process. In this demonstration process, a set of iterative SPARQL profiles are used for populating the data but for the documentation the final successful and amalgamated profiles are presented. In the process of data population, at first SPARQL SELECT queries are used to verify the available data in BIM models and then extended them into SPARQL CONSTRUCT and SPARQL INSERT queries to construct the extracted data into Digital Construction Lifecycle ontology. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>}</head><p>After the extraction of information from the BIM models (ifcOWL), construction queries are used to update the extracted information to DICL ontology. The table below illustrates these queries used for the data update process. Also, Table 21 illustrates a basic example of the constructed information according to the mentioned construction query within Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_40">20</ref>. Please note that here in this documentation prefixes used for the querying are not mentioned due to concern of document length. Also, the Class, object property, data property and instance declarations are as well not recorded in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_40">20</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.1.2">Filtering the data</head><p>The important segment in the demonstration process is the extraction or filtering of the information from the DICL ontology. This task is also performed as part of the ontology validation. As mentioned in the above subsection, the lifecycle ontology population is carried out by using SPARQL queries. The results from this ontology population process are mentioned in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_41">21</ref> below. The information in the below table only describes a sample of information about the single wall concerning the property representation and the construction details. In this subsection, this stored information is queried or filtered using also a set of SPARQL queries. These query profiles along with the results are elaborated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">22</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">23</ref>. Both the queries mentioned in the above tables are querying the information on a generic basis without concerning the specific LOD level. But this data extraction process can be limited to the specific LOD level by using the "FILTER" function from the SPARQL query. This FILTER function is already mentioned in the above query profiles but is disabled for querying the complete information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>D3. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>An ontology for representing data and information stored in BIM models at different LOD corresponding to renovation process modelling GA</figDesc></figure>

Within the DICL ontology, these activities are represented with the class dicp:Activity. All these activities are listed or structured according to the BLS stages defined from EN 16310. A class dicl:BLStage is adopted to indicate different Building Lifecycle Stages from different standards and publications. The representation of these activities in a specific BLS is achieved by generating the relationship between the classes dicp:Activity and dicl:BLStage by using object property dicl:hasActivity and its inverse property dicl:isActivityIn.</figDesc><graphic coords="37,54.27,71.90,485.89,222.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>

As defined in the ontology framework, the dicl:hasNextstage object property has an inverse relationship dicl:hasPreviousStage. Because of this definition, the dicl:hasPreviousStage relationship is inherited between these instances. Along with this inherited information also new relationships are generated between dicstg:Initiative and dicstg:Design, which is clearly represented in Figure 15. These generated relationships are because of the transitive property characteristic of the object properties dicl:hasNextstage and dicl:hasPreviousStage.</figDesc><graphic coords="42,49.02,347.07,495.75,280.99" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competency questions.</head><p>Based on the requirement analysis a set of competency questions are developed and adopted in the ontology development process. In general, these competenc questions are addressing the functional requirements of the ontology. List of these competenc questions are presented below.</p><p>CQ1: How can the BIM data representation be adjusted or modified to different LOD systems? CQ2: What is the link between the LOD system and its levels?  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1">BLS -Ontology representation</head><p>The application or the usage of BLS in building renovation projects is based on the locality, requirements, legislation, etc. Thus, a newly proposed ontological schema for a BLS should be capable to represent these different standards. Similar to the LOD framework, an ontological representation for the BLS framework is proposed to denote different lifecycle stages as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref>. As similar to the previous ontology development process, this development of ontology class and relationships to represent BLS is progressed based on the concept of Competency Questions (CQ). The development process is further explained below.</p><p>• CQ14: How to enable the representation of multiple BLS systems and/or stages?</p><p>The adopted modelling methodology is similar to the LOD approach elaborated in Section 3.1. In DICL ontology, the classes dicl:BLSFramework and dicl:BLStage are defined to represent various BLS systems and stages respectively. Various BLS systems can be defined as instances to the class dicl:BLSFramework and be assigned to the processes based on the project requirements. In the development of Digital Construction Lifecycle ontology, the elements related to the building lifecycle process (activity, BLS, agent, etc.) is also considered. However, this demonstration is not focused on those process elements. Nevertheless, the demonstration of these process elements can be performed by using the instances represented in Figure <ref type="figure">24</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">25</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">26</ref>. For more understandings, Table <ref type="table">24</ref> is developed with respect to a simple process concerning a set of activities and the involved agents in it. @prefix dicl: &lt;https://w3id.org/digitalconstruction/0.5/Lifecycle#&gt; .</p></div>

More specifically these discussions are extended on the representation of Building object properties and construction details. Similarly, the elaborated explanations on the adopted LOD frameworks and their ontological representations along with the applicability are provided in earlier sections of this document. The demonstration process clearly illustrates the applicability of the developed lifecycle ontology concerning the representation of BIM data and filtering the data based on the required Level of Detail.</p></div>			</div>
