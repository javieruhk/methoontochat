<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION 1.SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DELIVERABLE</head><p>As explained in D4.2 "BIMERR Ontology &amp; Data Model 1" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Chávez-Feria et. al., 2020]</ref>, the BIMERR interoperability approach relies on a common data model and an ontology to be shared and understood by all components connected to the BIMERRR Interoperability Framework (BIF). More precisely, the common data model, as a JSON version, is derived from the BIMERR ontology. Information technologies took the term "ontology" from philosophy and redefined it as "formal, explicit specifications of a shared conceptualization <ref type="bibr">[Studer et. a., 1998</ref>]. Concerning the BIMERR ontologies, they will be formalized following Description Logics and implemented in the W3C Web Ontology Language standard OWL. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> As there is a broad number of domains to be considered in the BIMERR conceptualization, the ontology to be developed will be organized as a modular ontology network. Some modules, or parts of them, will be aligned with existing standards or well-known ontologies that will be reused whenever possible. It is worth reminding that a number of models and ontologies to be reused were already analyzed in D4.1 <ref type="bibr">[Tiwari et.al. 2019]</ref>.</p><p>The goal of this deliverable is to describe (a) the BIMERR ontology network and the resources generated during its development including a detailed description of each module, and (b) the transformation process to achieve the desired JSON data model, considering all the requirements for updates and changes that have been considered up to M30. Finally, this document presents some conclusions about the steps followed and proposes next steps.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> represents the agile methodology followed during the ontology development process, described in detail in D4.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Chávez-Feria et. al., 2020]</ref>. This methodology is based on the LOT methodology<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[Poveda-Villalón et. al., 2019b]</ref> which was originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Poveda-Villalón, 2012</ref>] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[García-Castro et. al., 2017]</ref>. It is worth mentioning that some parts of the methodology have been adapted or specialized for the BIMERR project needs.</p><p>For the sake of understandability, readers not familiar with the concept of ontologies in computer science and the web are referred to "Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology" 4 as a basic reference for this topic.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">RELATION TO OTHER TASKS AND DELIVERABLES</head><p>This deliverable D4.3 is related to other BIMERR deliverables as indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BIMERR ONTOLOGY NETWORK AND DATA MODELS PORTAL</head><p>This section describes the whole ontology network developed for the BIMERR project as well as the main artefacts and resources obtained during its development. The models that have been created in this second iteration are analyzed in Section 3. Although this deliverable is focused on the design and implementation of the ontologies, it is important to remark that the results of this effort are both the ontologies and the data models that are finally supported by BIF.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">2</ref> summarizes the status of the ontologies on the first and the second releases.</p><p>During the development of the first sprint of the ontologies, the BIMERR network was devised to contain 8 modules. Two of those modules were: the Health &amp; Safety Issues and the Renovation Measures modules. However, in this second sprint, it was realized that the concepts and relations inside both modules could be covered with other related ontologies, such as the Annotation Objects and the KPI modules, respectively. In addition to that, new domains were identified, more concretely the Renovation Processes and the Information Objects domains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">THE BIMERR ONTOLOGY NETWORK</head><p>The BIMERR ontology network consists of nine modules, where each module represents a domain of the project. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> provides a graphical overview of the network, showing the main concepts of each module and the relations between them. Each color is associated to a different domain in the network to ease the identification of models. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> indicates the list of the prefixes and namespaces used to identify each domain along the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. BIMERR ontology network overview</head><p>In addition, white boxes in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> represent reused terms from existing ontologies. For instance, in the building module, the concept bot:Building is taken from the BOT ontology, which is not a BIMERR ontology but a reused one. The list of prefixes, and corresponding ontologies, reused along the development of the BIMERR model are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. As it can be observed, some of the ontologies reviewed in previous steps of the project were reused, like SAREF<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> and geo,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> as they are related to the project domain.</p><p>Furthermore, additional cross-domain ontologies were reused once the requirements and conceptualizations were analyzed in detail, as the case of the SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) and Time ontologies. As we can infer from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, an intricate relationship between the modules of the network exists, where the building ontology acts as the main bridge between the rest of the modules. These interconnections allow the integration of heterogeneous data, generated from the tools that compose the project, thus enabling the execution of complex queries that require data from different domains. The relationships between the modules are represented as arrows between the concepts of the ontology network, which formally are the equivalent to object properties in the ontology. For instance, the building:Element concept in the Building ontology is connected to the</p><p>The main hierarchies between concepts are also included. These hierarchies are represented by arrows with white endings (triangles) and can be read as follows: The class in the origin of the arrow is a subclass of the class in the end of the arrow.</p><p>It is worth noting that complete and up to date documentation of each ontology module is provided online and is accessible through each of the ontologies' URI. In the rest of this document only the main concepts or modeling decisions are detailed.</p><p>Apart from the domain-specific ontological requirements, the BIMERR ontologies development is based on the following non-functional requirements:</p><p>• Reuse: existing ontologies or standard models shall be reused when possible, thereby increasing interoperability with external systems that might be already using such ontologies. The point is also applied at the meta-level by using standard technologies to implement the ontologies themselves.</p><p>• Modularity: the ontology shall be designed as a network in which modules might be interconnected and refer to others.</p><p>• Good practices: the ontologies shall be developed following methodologies and best practices commonly used in ontology engineering in order to address ontology development activities such as design, implementation, evaluation, publication, and documentation, among others.</p><p>The graphical representation of the ontology network as well as the diagrams that represent each module follow a particular visual notation that is also used along this document. The visual notation used in the project is the one formulated in the Chowlk framework, which defines a set of graphical shapes for the design of ontology conceptualizations. The use of this notation not only allows the creations of UML-like models that can be used to document the ontologies, but also the automatic generation of the ontology implementation in a formal language (OWL) by means of a converter that is part of the framework. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> The complete documentation with respect to the notation can be found in the official website of the project. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref> Here we give a general overview of the conventions used in the diagrams, which is also detailed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3</ref>:</p><p>• Colored rectangles are used to denote classes created in the ontology being described, while white rectangles denote reused classes. For all the entities, it is indicated in which ontology they are defined by the prefix included before their identifier.</p><p>• Arrows are used to represent properties between classes and to represent some rdf, rdfs and owl constructs, more precisely: o Dashed arrows with the identifiers between stereotype signs (i.e., "&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;") refer to OWL<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">9</ref> constructs that are applied to some ontology elements, that is, they can be applied to classes or properties depending on the OWL construct being used.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">o</formula><p>o Dashed arrows with no identifier are used to represent the rdf:type relation, indicating that the element in the origin is an instance of the class in the destination of the arrow.</p><p>• Datatype properties are denoted by rectangles attached to the classes, in a UMLoriented way. Dashed boxes represent datatype properties that can be applied to the class it is attached to while plain boxes represent that the domain of the datatype property is declared to be the class attached.</p><p>• Individuals are denoted by rectangles in which the identifier is underlined. Literals are denoted by rectangles in which the value is included between quotation marks.</p><p>• The representation of additional property axioms (functional, inverse functional, transitive, and symmetric) that are being used in the diagram are shown in the overview ontology legend. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">THE BIMERR ONTOLOGY PORTAL</head><p>The BIMERR ontology portal gathers all the resources generated during the ontology development process. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">4</ref> shows a snapshot of the current state of the portal, which is available at https://bimerr.iot.linkeddata.es/. The portal has two sections, each one providing different resources:</p><p>• Ontologies: It is the main section of the portal, which shows the main information about the ontologies. This section follows a tabular approach which includes:</p><p>o Links to the ontologies' documentation published on the web. This documentation is generated automatically from the ontology implementation using the Widoco tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Garijo et. al., 2020]</ref>. 10 The documentation also includes links that point to the code of the ontology.</p><p>o An ontology description.</p><p>o Links to the GitHub repositories containing the code and other resources for each model.</p><p>o Links to the GitHub issue trackers.</p><p>o Links to the GitHub releases.</p><p>• Enriched ontologies: It contains the ontologies with enriched metadata, and the data models obtained after the transformation process as we can see in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the guidelines section that can be accessed through the main section, it provides the users with a brief overview of the proposed process for developing ontologies and some guidelines which should be followed by the domain experts and ontology developers who wants to contribute. This section includes information about:</p><p>• How the repository should be structured;</p><p>• The tools recommended to be used during the ontology development process;</p><p>• Ontology versioning;</p><p>• Issues management. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">ONTOLOGY RESOURCES</head><p>The resources generated during the process of ontology conceptualization, implementation and publication are centralized in GitHub repositories created for each individual domain, as it can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6</ref>. The information contained in the repositories is structured as follows:</p><p>• The diagrams folder: Contains the conceptualization diagrams of the developed ontology in an XML format.</p><p>• The documentation folder: Contains the HTML documentation of the model.</p><p>• The ontology folder: Contains the implementation of the ontology in Turtle format.</p><p>• The requirements folder: Contains the requirements of the ontology in tables and the ORSD (Ontology Requirements Specification Document) for each module. Additionally, the GitHub repositories support the maintenance of the ontology, by managing the list of issues identified by the domain experts and ontology developers.</p><p>All the changes and improvements to the ontology need to be agreed among all members of the ontology development team. The GitHub issue tracker is used to discuss improvements and issues about the domains. If domain experts or ontology developers want to add new concepts to the ontology, they have to create a new issue in the GitHub issue tracker, which will be used to start a discussion about the approval of the proposal.</p><p>GitHub issues are marked as "open" and "closed". The issues can also have an assignee, which is the person that is responsible for moving the issue forward. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7</ref> shows the issues section associated to the Building ontology.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">DATA MODELS</head><p>The JSON data models generated from the ontologies can be obtained from the BIMERR ontologies portal (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">9</ref>). When a new version of the ontology is generated, the ontology engineers need to manually update the data models stored in this section. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BIMERR ONTOLOGY NETWORK DESCRIPTION</head><p>In this section, the ontologies that composes the BIMERR network are thoroughly presented. The section provides a description of the usability of the model, an explanation of the conceptualization, example(s) of how to instantiate it, and a list of all the resources generated during the its implementation. Additionally, the links between the individual models are explained and some decisions made during its development are described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">BUILDING MODULE</head><p>The purpose of the Building Ontology is to represent the main spatial topological elements of a building. Furthermore, the model aims to represent the main components and systems that are directly involved in energy related aspects of buildings. This model acts as the core module within the BIMERR Ontology Network, where several other domains related to the building industry are connected to it. The model is constructed as an extension of the BOT ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Rasmussen et. al., 2020</ref>] that provides the vocabulary to describe the topology of a building as well as the relationships between their main components such as storey, zones, spaces, and building elements. Additionally, it reuses the building elements taxonomy from the SAREF4Building Ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Poveda-Villalón et. al., 2018]</ref>, a SAREF extension reusing the device hierarchy from IFC 4.1. This hierarchy was used to represent the components and systems that directly impact the energy consumption of buildings and are susceptible to change in a renovation project.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">10</ref> presents the main elements of the current state of the building model, their attributes as well as the relationships between them. We can see that the topological relationships flow from the most generic entity, that is building:Building to the most specific concept, which is building:Element, passing through the concepts of building:Apartment, building:Storey, and building:Space. However, we have also added some shortcut relationships between the concepts according to the requirements of the project.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> depicts the classification of building elements to be used under the scope of renovation projects. As mentioned before, most of the concepts in this hierarchy are reused from the SAREF4Building ontology, but we include only those that are relevant to the project according to the use cases. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref> shows this part of the model that reuses some terms and design patterns from the SAREF ontology. This section of the model is justified by the fact that some tools such as BICA will be used to report on properties of building elements such as HVAC components.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>. Building Ontology Conceptualization -Properties</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Model Description</head><p>The most important concepts related to the Building domain are the following:</p><p>• Building: Represents a structure that provides shelter for its occupants or contents and stands in one place. The building is also used to provide a basic element within the spatial structure hierarchy for the components of a building project (together with site, storey, and space).</p><p>• Storey: The building storey has an elevation and typically represents a (nearly) horizontal aggregation of spaces that are vertically bound.</p><p>• Space: A space represents an area or volume bounded actually or theoretically.</p><p>Spaces are areas or volumes that provide for certain functions within a building.</p><p>• Zone: A part of the physical world or a virtual world that is inherently both located in this world and having a 3D spatial extent.</p><p>• Apartment: A self-contained housing unit which is composed by several spaces.</p><p>• Element: An element is a generalization of all components that make up an AEC product.</p><p>The topological elements shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">10</ref>  Additionally, the building elements can be further described using properties (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>). The conceptualization of properties follows the design pattern of IFC, where properties of the same type or typical to specific elements are grouped into property sets.</p><p>Also, for the representation of the property values the design pattern from the SAREF Ontology is reused, where each property is related to a measurement, which has an associated a unit of measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Data Example</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">13</ref> presents an example of how to utilize the ontology for a fictional small building.</p><p>The building instance identified in the model as data:Building01 has an IFC identifier "2cZtnlll9DugwKjW2uDsyk" extracted from the IFC file, which is linked to this entity using the building:hasIFCFile relationship. The building is located at a latitude of 41.730330°, and a longitude of -2.441711°.</p><p>The  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Model Evaluation</head><p>The building ontology has been evaluated in two different ways. The first method consists in the detection of common pitfalls in the ontology implementation. Such pitfalls are identified using the OOPS! Web application <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Poveda-Villalón et. al., 2014]</ref>. 11 The results of the evaluation of this model are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">14</ref>. In this particular case, the building ontology has one critical error pointing that we are using the incorrect namespace for the term dc:license. By changing the URI of the term to the correct one http://purl.org/dc/terms/license, the error was solved. The important cases are mostly related to missing domain and range specification in the object properties and datatype properties of the ontology. However, not all the properties need a domain and range specification because some of them are used by several concepts; thereby, only some properties were modified. Finally, the minor errors section indicated the lack of inverse relationships which is something that is not addressed because there is no need or use case which supports the inclusion of those relationships in the model.</p><p>The evaluation results after executing OOPS! for a second time are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">15</ref>.</p><p>This time we can see that the critical errors has been solved and that the number of important errors has been reduced to just nine cases. The same process followed using OOPS! in this section is going to be repeated for the rest of the models, ensuring that no critical errors exist, and correcting important errors if appropriate. This process will not be described in the subsequent models in order to avoid repetitive information.</p><p>The second method evaluates the suitability of the model for a specific application <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Sabou et. al., 2012]</ref>, which in this case is the BIMERR Interoperability Framework. It is needed to evaluate if the model fulfills the requirements imposed from the BIF side in order to match the platform functionalities or its special features. In the specific case of the building data model additional properties were included. For instance, in order to avoid ambiguities with respect to the version of the IFC standard being used, the building:ifcVersion attribute was attached under the concepts that can be described by means of an IFC file.</p><p>Also, the building:type attribute was added in the building:Element concept in order to facilitate the querying of building components. Finally, the section of the ontology related to the description of properties and measurements has been replicated from the material properties ontology. This is a temporary modeling decision until the linking capabilities between models of BIF has been tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Links to other models</head><p>The building ontology is linked to two other modules: The KPI module and the Information Objects module. In order to discover which renovation projects have been performed over a building entity, the model includes the relation building:relatedProject between the concepts building:Building and kpi:Project.</p><p>Furthermore, we can link any topological element of the building to additional documents using the io:relatedDocumentation object property. We can be even more specific and ask for IFC files (io:relatedIFCFile) or OBJ files (io:relatedOBJFile).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Model Particularities</head><p>The structure of the data models finally expected by the BIMERR Interoperability</p><p>Framework imposes some restrictions and requirements over the ontologies developed in the project.</p><p>In the particular case of the building ontology additional attributes and relations were added in order to facilitate the population and querying of building information. For instance, the building:type attribute was added to query building elements by its type.</p><p>Even though, this operation is naturally supported by ontologies implemented in the OWL language, we need to include those artificial fields to allow those queries in BIF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.6">List of Resources</head><p>The following list of resources are provided for the building ontology:</p><p>• Ontology URI:</p><p>https://bimerr.iot.linkeddata.es/def/building/ </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">ANNOTATION OBJECTS MODULE</head><p>The Annotations Objects Ontology aims to represent the annotations produced during the development of a building renovation project. These annotations inform about issues found during the renovation activities or missing information not gathered during the surveying process that could be relevant for the project, such as missing building components. The model is based in the Building Collaboration Format (BCF), which is the standard for the representation of issues between different BIM modeling tools. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">16</ref> presents an overview of the concepts, relations and attributes included in the model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Model description</head><p>The main concepts in the model are ao:Topic and ao:Comment, which are inherited from the BCF standard. The ao:Topic represents reference information about the topic of the issue or annotation. We can describe those topics using attributes such as ao:identifier or ao:title. We can categorize those topics according to different aspect of the project:</p><p>• Stage (ao:stage): Preliminary Planning End, Construction Start, Construction End, etc.</p><p>• Label (ao:label): Architecture, Structure, Mechanical, Electrical, etc.</p><p>• Type (ao:topicType): Comment, Issue, Request, or Solution.</p><p>Additionally, the model gives the possibility to examine the full history of the modifications of this topic (ao:creationDate and ao:modifiedDate) and the authors of those changes (ao:creationAuthor and ao:modifiedAuthor), as well as assign an specific worker to solve the issue (ao:assignedTo).</p><p>Finally, it allows to add comments (ao:Comments) related to the topic at hand. The purpose of those comments is to record the discussion between different stakeholders and organization related to the topic. Similar to the case of topics we can keep a history of the modifications of those comments using the same fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Data Example</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">17</ref> illustrates a simple example of how to populate the ontology. In this case, we have the Topic data:Topic01 create by the Worker 01 related to electrical issues. This topic was created during the surveying stage of the project before the renovation activities start. It was categorized as an issue and is related to the electrical discipline. The topic has two comments linked to it, where data:Comment01 was create by the same author of the topic and describes that some electrical cables are hanging from the roof of one of the stories. The second comment data:Comment02 was created after two days just to confirm that the issue was solved.</p><p>The topic is further documented with images (data:ImageFile01) from the site and it is related to specific building components of the BIM model, in this case the data:Roof02. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Model Evaluation</head><p>The model has been evaluated using OOPS!, the detailed results are available at the ontology repository.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Links to other models</head><p>During the process of generating annotations, one worker may want to attach complementary information to the textual information that would better describe the problem. The model covers this requirement by linking the topics with the Information Objects ontology. The ao:InformationObjects concept represents any file that is stored in BIF. It is possible to make the connection between the topics and the files using any of the object properties defined in the model depending on the type of file to be referenced. For instance, one could use the ao:relatedImageFile to indicate the location of an image or the more general one ao:relatedDocumentation for file types not considered in the model.</p><p>The ontology is also connected to the building module to indicate to which topological elements (building:Space or building:Element) the topic refers to. Also a connection to the ao:Project concept from the KPI ontology is provided to allow the retrieval of all the issues related to the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">Model Particularities</head><p>As mentioned in the description section, we can categorize a topic using several classifications. For instance, we can classify it by the stage of the project it was taken, or by the type of issue it tries to address. We include that in the model by means of attributes attached at the Topic level. Each of those attributes can contain a set of default values, which can be naturally implemented in the ontology using RDF collections.

Each process is divided into smaller tasks that are assigned to specific workers. Those workers are notified about the activities they have to perform and report back the progress done in those activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Model description</head><p>The conceptualization of the ontology is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18</ref>. The renp:Process represents the processes that are specified on the workflow plan. Those processes can be further divided into smaller tasks (renp:Task). Both concepts can be assigned to one or more workers (renp:Worker) using the relation renp:executedBy in order to indicate who is the responsible for its execution. Apart from those core elements, we can connect the renp:Process and renp:Task with key performance indicators in order to communicated them to the workers on site so they are aware of the objectives to achieve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 18. Renovation Processes Ontology Conceptualization</head><p>The processes are further detailed using a series of attributes. It is possible to indicate which are the planned finishing and starting times (renp:plannedStart, renp:plannedFinish), and compare them to the actual figures on those metrics (renp:actualStart and renp:actualFinish). The model also allows the instantiation of the actual process on the process at hand by means of the datatype property renp:executionStatus.</p><p>In order to facilitate the querying of processes and tasks from the worker's side, the processes are connected to the topological elements of the building. This connection allows to know in which spaces (renp:performedAtSpace) or over which elements (renp:performedOverComponent) the renovation activities need to be performed. The installation of the material lift and crane was performed by the data:Worker01 with email email@company.com and personal identification "SomeInternalID".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">Links to other models</head><p>The renovation process model is connected to two other modules in the BIMERR Ontology Network. The first connection is with the Key Performance Indicators Ontology using the kpi:Project and kpi:KPI concepts. By making this connection we can facilitate the retrieval of all the processes related to a project, and the specification of planned and calculated KPI's by activities. The second connection is with the Building ontology, specifically with the following concepts: building:Space, building:Element, and building:Storey. As discussed earlier these links implemented at the process level enable the identification of all the activities that need to be executed by location or by building element.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.5">Model Particularities</head><p>The ontology includes concepts from the KPI ontology in order to support the use cases that deal with the notification of those metrics to workers on site. Some concepts from the KPI module were replicated in this ontology such as the kpi:KPIValue class to instantiate specific values for these indicators, as well as the saref:UnitOfMeasure concept to represent the units of these metrics. models in the BIF. This feature is basically driven by the fact that some tools do not require specific information from those files, but they need the document as a whole in its original format. Apart from that, there is a need to keep a track of the history of the information generated during the project. Some of the files that can be represented by the ontology are BIM files (IFC or OBJ files), obXML files, BPMN plans, PDF specifications, CAD files, images, etc.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Model description</head><p>The main concept in this ontology is the io:InformationObject class, that represents all the files and documents that are stored inside the BIMERR Interoperability Framework.</p><p>By using this entity to annotate our documents it is possible to add additional metadata to indicate attributes such as the location (io:location), the version of the document (io:version), the creator (io:creator) or the creation date (io:creationDate). The inclusion of these datatype properties allows the execution of more complex queries when searching for documents inside the BIMERR platform.</p><p>Furthermore, the ontology includes relations such as io:relatedDocumentation that allows that classes from other domains could also be linked to documents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.4">Links to other models</head><p>As it has been seen in the previous modules, the information objects ontology is the one that has more links with the rest of the models due to the universal requirement to attach documents to the different concepts that compose the BIMERR ontology network. In the case of the KPI ontology the connection is done between the kpi:Project and the io:InformationObject classes representing the need to keep track of all the information generated during the renovation project. Examples of documents attached at this level are renovation plans, contracts, etc. In the case of the annotations ontology, the need to store files is to support the description of issues and problem, detected during the renovation activities, with complementary information such as images, audios, or videos. Finally, the building module also allows the attachment of files to the topological elements of the building. For instance, the connection of OBJ or IFC files per storey.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Model description</head><p>The Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">22</ref> presents an overview of the classes, relations and attributes included in the Material Properties ontology. The purpose of the ontology is the description of building components defined within the BIMERR project that follow the material set definitions stated in the IFC 4 standard. Examples of these elements include walls, slabs and roofs. It is important to mention that building elements within the project that have not been defined using this convention, such as doors or windows, are not considered in this model, and can be directly described using properties sets in the building ontology. The material set definition indicates that an element may have a construction of type mat:MaterialLayerSet, mat:MaterialProfileSet, or mat:MaterialConstituentSet. These construction types can be further decomposed into mat:MaterialLayer, mat:MaterialProfile, and mat:MaterialConstituent respectively, where each of these entities has a set of related materials.</p><p>The materials can be described by a set of properties. For this purpose, we reuse the artifacts provided by the SAREF ontology. As we can see on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">22</ref>, the mat:Material class is related to the concept mat:PropertySet, which group together similar properties or properties that have a common denominator such was "properties for a wall". The properties inside a and their specific measurements by means of the relations mat:hasProperty, and mat:hasMeasurement, respectively. We avoid reusing the same relationships from the SAREF ontology because they have as domain the class saref:FeatureOfInterest, making mat:PropertySet a subclass of this concept, which is not semantically correct for our case. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Data Example</head><p>The Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">23</ref> shows an example of how we can use this ontology to describe the materials of a wall. The element described in this example is the wall data:Wall001 with IFC identifier "Wall01IFCGuid" that has a construction represented by the concept data:MaterialLayerSetWall01. This wall is composed by several layers, one of them is the layer data:MaterialLayerWall01 that has a thickness of 10 centimeters and is in the second position within the structure of the wall, where the ordering starts from the layer that interfaces with the internal spaces of the building.</p><p>This layer was made using brick masonry (data:BrickMasonry_01) as the main material, which has a set of properties that are organized in property sets (data:PropertySet01). One of the properties considered in this set is the Density (mat:Density), which for this specific material has a value equal to 1922 Kg-per-m3. </p></div>

The first one is related to the detection of pitfalls of the ontology using OOPS. The complete report can be seen in the ontology repository. The second method corresponds to the evaluation of the suitability of the ontology to represent the data it actually tries to model. This type of evaluation was performed during the development of the mappings between the data in the original format and the data in RDF format, which is finally stored in the Knowledge Graph Generator (KGG) component. For the case of the materials data model no problems arose during the transformation of the EnergyPlus materials database to RDF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">OCCUPANCY PROFILE MODULE</head><p>The Occupancy Profile ontology has been developed to represent people's behavior inside buildings with a focus on the energy impact their actions produce. This information is critical to get more precise building energy profiles, and generate simulation scenarios that fit better with reality. In this sense, the shared conceptualization represented in this ontology focuses on the interaction of occupants with the different systems inside building spaces that could influence their thermal comfort requirements. This ontology has been developed using the Occupancy Behavior XML Schema <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Hong et. al., 2019]</ref> as a basis, which defines the main. Some additional concepts as well as relations and attributes were added in order to obtain a full semantic representation of the domain.</p><p>The current conceptual model defined by the Occupancy Profile ontology is depicted in</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">24</ref>. This model reuses some concepts and properties from the SAREF For Building Ontology (SAREF4BLDG), an extension of the SAREF ontology, that was created mainly to support interoperability between smart appliances in a building context. Some of the most important concepts related to the Occupancy Profile domain are the following:</p><p>• Physical Object: This concept refers to any object that has a proper space region such as the equipment or mechanisms within the building with which occupants may interact to restore or maintain environmental comfort.</p><p>• Occupant: This concept represents people that reside within a building or make use of specific spaces within it.</p><p>• Behavior: This concept is used to define the behaviors that people have inside a space. These behaviors could lead to interactions with systems.</p><p>• Driver: This entity represents the stimulating factors that provoke energy-related occupant behavior. A driver prompts a building occupant to perform either an action or in-action with a building system, impacting the energy use of a building.</p><p>• Action: This concept represents the interactions with systems or activities that occupants can perform to achieve environmental comfort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1">Model description</head><p>The main concepts defined in the ontology and shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">24</ref>, are:</p><p>building:Building, building:Apartment, building:Space, op:Occupant, op:Behavior, op:Driver, op:Action and s4bldg:PhysicalObject previously defined in Section 3.1. In the model conceptualization, we can observe that the class building:Building can have several spaces, which are concatenated in the concept building:Apartment, and is related to them through the property bot:Apartment.</p><p>Those apartments have several spaces (building:Space). building:Space object can contain several systems that an occupant can interact with. From the obXML schema we have a list of systems that can be accommodated under the class s4bldg:PhysicalObject. Equipment such as HVAC's or shading devices can be represented by the classes saref:HVAC or s4bldg:ShadingDevice respectively. For systems not available in S4BLDG we created new terms, like the concept op:Window. Several persons can occupy a specific space, where each occupant can have more than one behavior. Attached to the occupant concept, information about its personal profile can be indicated by means of the attributes op:occupantAge, op:occupantGender, op:name, op:occupantJobtype, and op:occupantLifestyle.</p><p>A behavior could refer to an action, where the concept op:Action involves the following subclasses: op:Report, op:Movement and op:Interaction. A person can also decide to not perform any action if its comfort levels are not satisfied; this scenario is modeled by means of the class op:Inaction. The interaction of an occupant with a system can be represented using mathematical models. This is addressed using the property op:describedByFormula where the destination is the concept op:InteractionFormula, which groups several off-the-shelve mathematical functions.</p><p>One example of specialization is the concept op:LinearFormula which gathers all the linear models that have at least one parameter in its definition.</p><p>For a mathematical formula to be properly defined we need a list of its coefficients and independent parameters. In order to model that, the relationships op:hasCoefficient and op:hasIndependentVariable were created. The first property (op:hasCoefficient) allows the connection from a given formula to an instance that will be linked to a certain numerical value and name by means of the data properties op:coefficientValue and op:name, respectively. The second property (op:hasIndependentVariable) links a given formula with a parameter that describes a certain environmental factor of the building space.</p><p>Additionally, the model should allow to express if the occupant needs are influencing in a certain way its behavior. For that purpose, the property op:influencedByNeed was implemented. These needs can be further categorized into Physical Needs, and Non-Physical Needs. Non-physical needs gather together all the possible instances that could not be quantified such as privacy, status, etc. On the other hand, Physical Needs represent comfort requirements that could be defined by fixed limits. To handle this, the concept op:ParameterRange was created, which indicates the maximum and minimum value for a specific environmental parameter (op:EnvironmentalParameter).</p><p>Apart from human-system interactions, there are other kind of occupant activities that are important from the energy consumption perspective. Occupant's movements to describe when other type of drivers typically occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Data Example</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">25</ref> shows a small example of how to use this model to represent occupancy behavioral data. The space data:S2_Researcher_Office is an office occupied by 4 researchers. In this example only 2 occupants are described. This space contains two energy related systems: A thermostat (data:Thermostat_1) and a HVAC (data:HVAC_1). The first occupant is the data:OC_Researcher_1 researcher which has the behavior to set the thermostat to 23ºC according to a certain probability. The second researcher (data:OC_Researcher_2) has the behavior to set the HVAC system to 27ªC.</p><p>Additionally, it is possible to indicate the operational mode of the HVAC that is this case is zone on off (data:ZoneOnOff). </p></div>

The complete report can be seen in the ontology repository.</p><p>The second method evaluates the suitability of the model to the BIMERR Interoperability</p><p>Framework. After the evaluation, additional concepts and relations were included in order to support the all functionalities of BIF. For instance, in order to facilitate the mapping and the access of the data inside the model, it was necessary to create the op:OccupantBehavior concept that acts as a root node from which the rest of concepts can be accessed. Furthermore, additional inverse relationships were added such as the op:isInsideSpace object property between the op:Occupant and building:Space concepts.</p></div>

These devices will be used to estimate building resident energy profiles, by measuring indirectly the interaction between occupants and systems. For the construction of this ontology, the SenML standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[SenML, 2018]</ref> was taken as a basis.</p><p>The current conceptual model defined by the Sensor Data ontology is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">26</ref>. This model reuses concepts and properties from the SAREF ontology which is intended to enable interoperability between different IoT solutions from different manufacturers.</p><p>Some of the most important concepts taken from SAREF are the following:</p><p>• Property: An aspect of an entity that can be observable by a sensor.</p><p>• Device: A tangible object designed to accomplish a particular task in households, common public buildings or offices. In order to accomplish this task, the device performs one or more functions.</p><p>• Measurement: Represents the measured value made over a property. It is also linked to the unit of measure in which the value is expressed and the timestamp of the measurement.</p><p>• Unit of Measure: The unit of measure is a standard for measurement of a quantity, such as a Property. Finally, a record is not only an estimation of a physical property of the world, it also describes a particular thing or context as for instance, the temperature or illuminance within an apartment's room. With this in mind, the property saref:isMeasurementOf is used to link a measurement to the concept saref:FeatureOfInterest, which represents all the entities that are being described or acted over by the devices.  </p></div>

This type of measures serves not only to get a correct estimation of the advances in the renovation workflow, but also to adjust the planning of the construction activities and improve the communication with stakeholders. The conceptualization proposed also focuses on the relation between KPIs, projects and scenarios. The construction of this ontology has been done using the requirements and needs identified for the PWMA and RenoDSS BIMERR applications.</p><p>The up-to-date conceptual model defined for the Key Performance Indicator ontology is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">24</ref>. This model follows good ontology engineering practices, and reuses some terms from existing models, specifically concepts from SAREF for City (SAREF4CITY), which is an extension of the SAREF ontology. Some of the most relevant concepts in the model are defined below:</p><p>• KPI: A type of performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages.</p><p>• KPI Value: A quantity assessment of the KPI being evaluated. It also takes into account the time at which the indicator was calculated.</p><p>• Project: The building renovation project the KPI metric is related to.</p><p>• Scenario: The particular conditions under which the KPI is being evaluated.</p></div>

In this case, the KPI to describe is data:ScaffoldCost which is related to the scaffold installation cost. This KPI is quantified by the data:ScaffoldKPIValue01 entity, which has a value of 300000 euros. This KPI value is related to the data:BimerrProject01 project and the data:SimulatedScenario001 scenario. At the same time, this KPI value can be estimated given a set of parameters such as time, cost per unit, and number of units of scaffold. </p></div>

Each of these elements should have an IFC identifier that uniquely identify them in the IFC model and corresponds to the IfcGlobalId attribute in that schema. The model builds around the root concept building:Building, that incorporates attributes to indicate its physical location by means of geospatial coordinates (wgs84_pos:long, wgs84_pos:lat, and wgs84_pos:alt) provided by the W3C geo vocabulary. The relationships between the topological elements are taken directly from BOT. A building may have several stories, which in turn may contain one or more residential apartments. These relationships are materialized by the object properties bot:hasStorey and building:hasApartment respectively. An apartment has different spaces such as a living room, a kitchen or bedroom, and these spaces comprise of building components that delimit the zone itself (building:Door, building:Slab, building:Window, and building:Wall) and by energy related equipment (building:SpaceHeater or building:Fan). Some applications within the BIMERR solution require the original IFC representation of the topological elements. The model allows the connection to those files by means of the building:hasIFCFile relation, which points to an internal location within BIF.Another aspect of the model is the classification of elements that are typically considered in building renovation projects focused on energy efficiency. Those elements are represented in the model by the building:Element concept, which is also included in the IFC schema. Usually, these elements have an impact over the energy performance of buildings. The elements classification used in this ontology (concepts under the superclass building:Element in Figure11) follows the structure proposed by the IFC 4 standard.</figDesc></figure>

The second storey (data:Storey02) contains one apartment (data:Apartment03), where only the living room (data:Space03) is represented. This space contains some energy related devices such as a space heater and an outlet.</figDesc></figure>

The first task is the installation of the material lift and crane (data:Task001) followed by the installation of safety measures (data:Task002). Both task are connected sequentially by the renp:hasNextTask relation. The initial plan considered that data:Task001 should start at 2020-01-01 and should finish at 2020-01-20; however, the task took more time and the actual finished time was 10 days after the initial planned date. The completion of data:Task001 gives permission for the start of the second task (data:Task002) that was planned for 2020-02-01 and currently it is only completed at 50%.</figDesc></figure>

There are two types of movements covered in the model, random movements inside spaces, represented by the class op:RandomMovement, and status transition movements between spaces, represented by the concept op:StatusTransition. Status transition events can be approximated by probabilistic models such as the Markov Model, being the connection between both concepts the property op:specifiedBy. The particular attributes needed for each stochastic model are attached to their respective class. For instance the op:NormalProbabilisticModel requires the attributes op:typicalTime and op:earlyOccurTime during its instantiation. Finally, a behavior can be caused by several factors, either internal or external. The object property op:drivenBy represents this relation, where the destination of the property is the class op:DriverSet, which allows to combine multiple drivers. This model decision allows to represent time (op:Time) as a driver by itself or as complementary information</figDesc></figure>

With this goal in mind, the whole conceptualization circulates around the term kpi:KPIValue, that as defined previously in section 3.3, is a detailed specification of a performance indicator. This new concept is an extension of the class s4city:KeyPerformanceIndicatorAssessment of SAREF4CITY ontology, which already includes some attributes useful for our purposes such as saref:hasValue. Those attributes allow us to state a numerical value to the metric being evaluated as well as a detailed description of what is being assessed. KPI values define quantitatively a specific indicator. This relation is modeled by the object property s4city:quantifiesKPI, that connects to the kpi:KPI concept. In order to reuse some of the attributes and relations previously defined in the SAREF4CITY ontology, . It is possible to use the attribute kpi:name to provide a proper name to our KPI individuals. However, the units in which we are expressing the value of performance indicators also need to be provided, we model that by adding the attribute kpi:unit to the KPI definition. Additionally, data properties such as kpi:identifier and kpi:description are added to achieve a full description of the concept.Finally, a KPI value exists within the context of a project, which is the activity we are trying to measure the success of. This relation is represented by the property kpi:relatedProject linking a KPI value to the concept kpi:Project. Furthermore, a KPI value is calculated under certain conditions. The conceptualization models this set of conditions by means of the class kpi:Scenario. The connection used to link both concepts is the object property kpi:relatedScenario. Each scenario has several renovation measures that are applied over specific elements of the building.</figDesc></figure>

However, there are other terms that were created in order to cover the requirements from the BIF side. For instance, the inclusion of the term bm:sensitive to model sensitive data or bm:timeZone to indicate the time zone of the data. In Table 5 we can identify those new terms by the prefix bm which corresponds with the namespace http://bimerr.iot.linkeddata.es/def/bimerrmetadata. that accelerated the development of the conceptualizations and improves the understanding of the models created. It also allowed us to automate the generation of the first versions of the ontological implementations. The Chowlk framework is composed of two parts: a) the visual notation and b) the converter from the conceptual diagrams to the OWL code. Another output from the application of this tool was the refinement of the visual shapes included in the first version of the visual notation, which allows us to be more effective in the representation of the models. The existence and management of two versions of the BIMERR model, the ontology version and the JSON data model version, imposed some restrictions and requirements</figDesc></figure>

Figure <ref type="figure">20</ref> shows the concepts and relations involved in the model.</p><p>During the information exchange process between the renovation tools there are certain types of files that do not require a very detailed description or representation of their data    During the processes and different tasks activities related to the BIMERR Interoperability Framework it became apparent that the well-known Competency Questions technique <ref type="bibr">[Grüninger and Fox, 1995]</ref> is sometimes not the most suitable solution for every project and situation. Although it might be helpful to identify main concepts and top-level relations, it is not optimal for all use cases. For example, when the interlocutor's profile is closer to the actual data to be modelled in the ontology or data model, more structure artefacts help to better describe the data exchange requirements. In this sense, the use of adapted templates from METHONTOLOGY <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Fernández-López et. al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">] [Fernández-López et. al., 1999]</ref> has greatly improved the efficiency and communication between ontology and data model developers and the partners involved in the data extraction requirements. In addition, such templates have been designed taking into account the ontology and data model needs, gathering in one place all the information. This feature allowed us to reduce the number of iterations and resources generated during the task, and therefore, the need to constantly maintain the templates. In other cases, mostly when the model development has already started, it has been proved more practical to use a conceptual model as a communication tool with domain experts so that new entities and relations are reflected directly in the shared models rather than in a requirements list.</p></div>			</div>
