<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Introduction: Purpose of the deliverable, contributions of partners, and relationships between the work done in this task with other work packages. Particularly, this section highlights the relation between the ontology design methodology devised in this task and other lines of work of the project such as the use case methodology and the semantic integration process.</p><p>2. Ontology design methodology: Purposes of ontology design, evaluation of existing methodologies including the most relevant precedents of methodologies for ontological design. Since no methodological approach takes into account the integration of data sources and their querying using federated access, SEMANCO's design methodology has been devised. It is composed of three phases -vocabulary building, implementation and evaluation-which are described in this section, as well as their sub tasks: Vocabulary capture, Building of an initial vocabulary, Data sources' vocabularies mappings, TBox coding, Data sources integration, and Evaluation. Finally, how this methodology has been applied and integrated in the overall project development is described.</p><p>3. Properties of SEMANCO's ontology: Description of the base structure which has been built upon modules of the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). The details of the two hierarchies, based on subsumption and aggregation properties, are described. The application of the DL-Lite A formalism is presented. Further the main features that must be taken into account in the SEMANCO context are described: data properties have to be functional, the explicit definition of domains and ranges should only allow data properties, and the domains and ranges of object properties must be specified by means of axioms. The definition of the units of measure is also included in this section. The values of the data sources are related to a specific class of unit of measure which is based on the SUMO ontology. Finally, the annotation 2013-05-15</p><p>properties are illustratedlabels, comments, references, and authors. These have been implemented in the ontology and are fully supported by the ontology editor.</p><p>4. Conclusions: Contributions of the semantic energy model to the project development particularly as a mediator schema for individual data sources. The most important featuresthe use of the upper-level modules of the SUMO ontology, the application of DL-Lite A formalism to optimize data access, and the specification of units of measure based on SUMO modulesare outlined. The semantic energy model developed in this task is one of the first implemented ontologies using the DL-Lite A formalism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Appendices:</head><p>A representative sample of the ontology code can be found in the Appendix. It includes the definition of the object property, data properties, classes and the DL-Lite A axioms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION 1.Purpose and target group</head><p>The purpose of this deliverable is to report about the work done in Task 4.2 Design of a semantic energy model.</p><p>The semantic energy model is a formal ontologyspecified using Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL 2)comprising concepts developed within the SEMANCO project that have been captured from diverse documents concerning standards, use cases and activity descriptions and data sources containing data related to the three case studies. It provides the language to understand and interpret the complexity of different data sources and their interrelations; a language which enables semantic tools and users to use the data stemming from different domains and applications. Specifically, the language consists of the terms and attributes necessary to describe regions, cities, neighbourhoods and buildings, as well as to relate this to energy related data including climate and socio-economic factors.</p><p>Ontologies are a central component of the SEIF. Their purpose is twofold i) helping to integrate data distributed in heterogeneously structured data sources, ii) facilitating data access and interoperability of tools used to evaluate energy performance in urban planning.</p><p>Ontology designers and technicians are the main target groups of this document. However the structure of the vocabulary of the semantic energy model is also of interest for domain experts such as urban planners and energy advisors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Contribution of partners</head><p>The work carried out in Task 4.2 was led by FUNITEC and HAS. POLITO has collaborated with the work done in Tasks 3.2 and 3.3, whose outputs are instrumental for this task.</p><p>The ontology has been coded by HAS and FUNITEC using an ontology editor developed in Task 4.3 by HAS.</p><p>The report has been jointly written by HAS and FUNITEC. The internal review has been carried out by Ilaria Ballarini (POLITO) and Martin Carpenter (UoT) who has also done the final proofreading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Relations to other activities in the project</head><p>The semantic energy model is the core component of the Semantic Energy Information Framework (SEIF), which in turn is the central component of the entire environment developed in the project.</p><p>The implementation of the semantic energy model is the logical consequence of the work done in Work Package 3 which provided the specification of the informal vocabulary, the identification of data sources and their informal mapping onto a vocabulary. Therefore, the semantic energy model is used as the mediating schema for the representation of the semantics of the data sources. The single data source schemas are mapped onto semantic energy model and by this means, interlinked with each other. The terminology of the semantic energy model, formally specified as an ontology TBox<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , is referred via SPARQL queries triggered by tools that have been developed in Work Package 5. The relevant parts of the queries are evaluated against single data sources. The results of the queries are transformed into the vocabulary of the semantic energy model and delivered to the tools that have launched the query.</p><p>An ontology design process has been devised and it is aligned with (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>):</p><p>-The use cases methodology described in Deliverable 1.8 Project Methodology. Use cases bring together information about actors, policies and activities to fulfil a goal at a particular scale. This information is the first input of the ontology design methodology.</p><p>-The semantic integration process described in Deliverable 4.1 Environments for collaborative ontology mapping. This process relies on the existence of a global ontology which acts as a reference for the data sources. Furthermore, the semantic integration process covers the mapping coding stage of the ontology design methodology. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ONTOLOGY DESIGN METHODOLOGY</head><p>Methodologies to build ontologies are needed to avoid the unnecessary duplication of work and to reduce the rate of design errors. The relevant work on ontology design was started by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gruber (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Uschold &amp; King (1995)</ref> who proposed an ontology design process based on four phases: identifying the purpose of the ontology, building the ontology, evaluating and documenting the ontology. The ontology building phase is subdivided into three steps: 1) ontology capture, 2) ontology coding and 3) integration of existing ontologies. This approach has been further elaborated, for instance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fernandes, Guizzardi &amp; Guizzardi (2011)</ref>. A survey of methodologies for ontological design can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fernández-López (1999)</ref>. However, they are mostly focused on modelling the conceptualization of a specific domain rather than on the integration of data sources in a manner supporting their querying using federated access. Furthermore, a methodology per se is not enough. It should be supported by design patterns, document templates, tools or platforms, which guide developers along the process.</p><p>A methodology for the design of the semantic energy model has been devised to take into account the integration of multiple data sources with the purpose to facilitate integrated access to these sources. This methodology supports ontology design decisions with reference to the semantic integration process described in Deliverable 4.1. On the one hand, it helps to analyse and effectively reflect structures and terms used in the data sources and in the resulting ontology code. On the other hand, this methodology determines the design of data source mappings described in D4.1 as well as the design of the queries carried out by the tool that are being developed in the Work Package 5.</p><p>SEMANCO's ontology design has been carried out according to the process model described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Nemirovskij, Nolle, Sicilia, Ballarini &amp; Corrado (2013)</ref> which is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. It encompasses three phases:</p><p>-A vocabulary building phase which comprises the specification of use cases, building of an initial vocabulary and the assembling of informal mapping tables, revealing relations between terms of vocabularies used in individual data sources and terms forming the initial vocabulary.</p><p>-An implementation phase which embraces formal TBox coding and integration of data sources into the Semantic Energy Information Framework with the purpose of enabling federated query processing on the basis of the distributed data sources.</p><p>-An evaluation phase aimed at the assessment of the Semantic Energy Model, coded on OWL and at the data source mappings coded in D2RQ language <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bizer &amp; Cyganiak, 2007)</ref> with reference to the informal specification of the final vocabulary and use cases that have been generated in the vocabulary building phase. At this phase, three different evaluation strategies are applied: TBox intelligibility check, mapping compliance check and the assessment of computational efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2013-05-15</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Process model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Nemirovskij et al. 2013)</ref> Each of the phases of the process model is composed of tasks. The vocabulary building phase starts with the vocabulary capture taking the uses cases and activities as inputs. Then, in the second task, an initial vocabulary is built based on existing standards. Finally, in the third task the mapping between the data sources and the vocabulary is carried out. In the implementation phase two tasks are performed: TBox coding in which an ontology editor is used to create the ontology, and Mapping data sources by which D2RQ mapping files are generated for each data source according to the ontology. Finally, the evaluation phase deals with the assessment of the ontology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Vocabulary building</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Vocabulary capture</head><p>The first step of the ontology design process relies on the capture of the base terminology for the ontology. To perform high quality conceptualisation and to give appropriate names to the ontology concepts it is important to take into consideration the users' perspective. In the SEMANCO project, this was achieved through the use case specifications that were created at the beginning of the ontology design process. As has been described in Deliverable 1.8, use case specifications are based on a specification template consisting of a set of attributes, i.e. goal, urban scale, process scale, authors, related policy framework and a list of activities (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Relationships between activities and use cases</head><p>In turn, each activity is specified using a template that is similar to the one used for the specification of use cases. The activity specification template (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) contains the fields used in the use case template (goal, urban scale, process scale, actors, related policy and framework) and the input and output data specifications which are considered candidates to become concepts of the semantic energy model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2013-05-15</head><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. An activity specification generated using activity specification template</p><p>The graphic representation of use cases and the detailed specification of activities help to understand the users' requirements, to identify the data they need, to set the semantics of the data, and to determine the desired level of value aggregation. Yet, the activity specifications not only serve for the vocabulary capturing. Also, they are an ideal instrument for query design that becomes essential in the context of data integration. As stated above, in the SEMANCO project the query design serves as a connection between the ontology development (Work Package 4) and the development of end-users' tools (Work Package 5).</p><p>The use case driven approach for ontology capturing is similar to the goal modelling approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fernandes et al. (2011)</ref>. However, the goal of modelling is basically applied to formulate the so-called "competency questions" (Suárez-Figueroa, Gómez-Pérez, Motta &amp; Gangemi, 2012) which are less appropriate for query design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Building the initial vocabulary</head><p>The second step of the ontology design process takes use case and activity specifications as an input and has the goal of defining an initial vocabulary, that is, a categorized set of terms connected with each other by simple relations. At the same time, the terms of the vocabulary  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). The vocabulary is composed of 24 categories including building use, climate and building geometry. Each of these categories contains numerous terms identified in the various activities. Apart from the terms, the initial vocabulary describes the relations between terms and becoming, in this way, similar to the formal ontology specification.</p><p>In this table, the terms can be related with two types of relation: subsumption (is) and aggregation (has). For instance in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> Air Temperature is connected to the term Climatic_Parameter by means of their relationship. This means that the corresponding concept Air_Temperature subsumes the concept Climatic_Parameter.</p><p>Building an initial vocabulary is an important intermediate step towards the design of the semantic energy model. It simplifies formal ontology coding significantly by using a formal language like OWL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Mappings of data sources' vocabularies</head><p>In this third and last step of the vocabulary building phase, the names of the data entities from sources that have been integrated are mapped to the initial vocabulary. If a target data source is a relational data base, then the fields of their tables are mapped to the terms of the initial vocabulary. Such mapping is specified with a table as the one shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>.  According to the table above, the term Air Temperature contained in the initial vocabulary is mapped on the term Average set point temperature from the targeted data source. This information serves as a direct instruction for the coding of the mapping implemented using D2RQ language. Unfortunately, not all of the terms used in the individual the data sources can be univocally mapped in terms of the initial vocabulary, (see rows 5 and 6 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). If this is the case, ontology designers face three alternatives: to modify/extend the initial vocabulary (which is the most often selected alternative); to implement non-trivial mapping preferences or to specify complex queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Implementation</head><p>The implementation phase of the process model encompasses two tasks: TBox coding and mapping data sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">TBox coding</head><p>The semantic energy model has its basis on the DL-Lite A formalism which outperforms most of the other description logic formalisms in the context of managing data distributed in heterogeneously structured sources. The coding of the Semantic Energy Model's is carried out by SEMANCO's ontology editor described in Deliverable 4.3 User interfaces for knowledge representation (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The reasons for the development of our own editor instead of using an existing one (e.g. Protégé 6 ) are basically two, the participation of domain experts which require a non-technical interface and the coding support of DL-Lite A axioms to represent domains and ranges of object properties which requires processing of reasoning (for more detailed illustration of DL-Lite A properties see Section 3.2). Ideally, such reasoning should be carried out each time after the ontology has been edited. To our knowledge, on the fly inference is not available in editors such as Protégé. Furthermore, the specification/management of axioms required by the DL-Lite A formalism which are needed to determine domains and ranges of roles is a complex and error prone process. Instead, 6 http://protege.stanford.edu SEMANCO's ontology editor only requires a mouse click in the context menu to trigger the automated generation of such axioms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4. SEMANCO's ontology editor facilitates simultaneous graphic presentations of selected ontology parts</head><p>At the core of the coding process lies the ontology TBox. Most of the individuals and data values are naturally specified in the data sources to be integrated. Exceptionally there might be a set of individuals related to management and the calculation of units of measure that belong to the core of the semantic energy model and hence, they are specified in the implementation phase. This part of the ontology is described in Section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Mapping data sources</head><p>In this step, the informal mappings of data sources vocabulariessuch as those shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> -and the ontology TBox are used to transform the contents of the data sources into RDF resources. After coding the mappings using a formal language of a dedicated middleware, the data stored in relational data bases becomes available for SPARQL querying in terms of the target TBox. These mappings are implemented with declarative mapping languages which offer rich expressive features to bring the rigid relational schemas to real cases. In SEMANCO we have opted for D2RQ which is supported by the D2R server, a mature and stable lightweight middleware. However, the option for application of other software products, as Quest (Rodriguez-Muro &amp; Calvanese, 2012) and RDB to RDF Mapping Languages such as R2RML 7 in SEMANCO remains open.</p><p>The creation of these mappings is a complex process which involves experts from different domains having different skills. Furthermore, the mappings should be aligned with the TBox ontology created in step 4. This requires an understanding of both the structure of the ontology and the data sources. To support this process, two environments were developed in Deliverable 4.1 Environments for collaborative ontology mapping, using D2RQ language: a) the OWL mapping extractor to extract an OWL ontology file and a D2RQ mapping file from the structure of a relational database; b) the ontology mapping collaborative web environment that provides a graphical interface to assist non-ontology experts to implement the mappings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Evaluation</head><p>With regard to the data integration goal, the following three properties of the Semantic Energy Model are evaluated:</p><p>TBox Intelligibility: the ability of actors that use the ontology to understand the ontology structure. Mappings compliance: correspondence of mappings with the TBox. Computational efficiency: the ability of the ontology to support conjunctive querying on high efficiency level, for example, with a comparatively short response time.</p><p>TBox Intelligibility: especially as a consequence of vocabulary mappings in step 3, the initial structure and semantics of the vocabulary designed in step 2 of the development process (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) can get unintentionally altered. The intelligibility test is carried out by independent testers, who are asked to find ontology concepts by navigating along its TBox graph. The navigation is done using SEMANCO's ontology editor. In the test completed at the early stages of the ontology development two independent groups of users were involved: a group of computer science students, and another formed by experts in the field of building energy. The average score of each group is measured with reference to the shortest navigation path. Our experiments have shown surprisingly, average scores of 97.30% for computer science students and 91.20% for domain experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mappings compliance:</head><p>The purpose of this evaluation strategy is to reveal mappings that do not correspond to the TBox of the Semantic Energy model. As shown in Rodriguez ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) a set of mappings defines an "implicit" TBox. Such TBox contains the concepts referred in the mappings. From the logic of the integration procedure, these concepts should belong to the Semantic Energy Model. The idea of the mapping compliance test is to make such TBox explicit and verify if it builds a subset/sub-graph of the Semantic Energy Model TBox.</p><p>Computational efficiency: in the focus of this methodology is the evaluation of the query processing. Queries used for the evaluation are generated on the basis of the use cases and activity description specified in step 1 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Results and the time required for query processing is subject to evaluation. In addition, alternative designs of ontology parts can be compares with each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Ontology development process</head><p>The ontology design methodology is a transversal process which is carried out in different tasks of the project. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the ontology design process with the different tasks that have been carried out. Blue circles are the step number, green boxes indicate the deliverables and tasks where the step is carried out, and the arrows define the relations between steps. The text in bold like "Standard Tables" or "Semantic Energy Model" are outputs of a step and the regular text such as "Ontology Editor" represent tools that have been used to carry out a certain step. For example, the description of how the "Building of an initial vocabulary" step has been carried out can be found in Deliverables 3.2 and 3.3. Their output, the Standard Tables, has been coded by ontology engineers and domains experts using the ontology editor in the TBox coding step of the methodology.</p><p>2013-05-15 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROPERTIES OF SEMANCO'S ONTOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Base structure</head><p>Following a modular approach to ontological design, the semantic energy model has been built on with modules of the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). In this way, each concept of the semantic energy model is subsumed at least by one concept of SUMO. The foundational relationships and axioms from SUMO remain valid in the semantic energy model. The solutions to the philosophical, engineering and linguistic issues addressed by the SUMO ontology are inherited by the semantic energy model.</p><p>The selection of SUMO as upper-level ontology was made following a comparative analysis with four other foundational ontologies; DOLCE, PROTON, General Formal Ontology (GFO) and Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). SUMO scored well in terms of simplicity of understanding, applicability for reasoning and inference purposesespecially from the time performance perspectiveand number of concepts related to the domain of interest, in particular urban planning. For example, the concept Building of the semantic energy model is subsumed by SUMO's concept of StationaryArtifact and SUMO's Attribute subsumes Geometry, which, in turn subsumes BuildingGeometry, both are defined in the Semantic Energy Model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">BuildingGeometry ⊑ BuildingProperty ⊑ Attribute</formula><p>The resulting semantic energy model consists of two hierarchies: one is the taxonomy based on the concept of subsumption (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), the other hierarchy comprises the aggregation properties (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>). The upper level of this taxonomy is built of SUMO concepts. The building elements of this second hierarchy (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>) are non-subsumption properties, basically of aggregative nature. The property names begin with "has" prefix, for example, hasGeometry or hasAir_Temperature. The SEMANCO ontology editor offers to the user two simultaneous views of an ontology: one for editing the taxonomy of concepts, and another one for editing the graph of nonsubsumption relations. A user can generate new concepts by editing both views. However, because of some foundations of description logics, when a concept is integrated into the network of non-subsumption relations it has to be integrated also into the taxonomy. To avoid continuously switching between views, concepts generated in the non-subsumption view are all initially subsumed by the aggregative concept Suspense which is used as a temporary container for new concepts and has any particular semantics. Later on, for each concept subsumed by Suspense other parent concepts might be selected from the structure of the informal vocabulary (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) and the semantics of the domain of discourse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">DL-Lite A formalism</head><p>For the coding of the semantic energy model, we have selected the DL-Lite A formalism. The DL-Lite A was designed taking into account the requirements of data integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Poggi et al., 2008)</ref>. Furthermore DL-Lite A is one of the members of the DL-Lite family of description logics. Another member of this family, DL-Lite R that has lots of features in common with DL-Lite A , serves as a basis for the OWL QL profile of OWL 2, designed for the purpose of data access/management<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">8</ref> .</p><p>The most important features of DL-Lite A are the following: 1) the restriction requiring that all data properties have to be functional; 2) the rule determining that explicit specification of domains and ranges of roles is allowed only for data properties; for instance, roles connecting individuals of a concept with a domain of values, real or integer, and its prohibition for object properties, for example, roles connecting individuals of two concepts; and 3) the requirement to specify domains and ranges of object properties by means of axioms. For example, the following axioms in DL notation use subsumption (⊑), existence </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Units of measure</head><p>The data sources to be integrated by means of the Semantic Energy Information Framework (SEIF) contain a lot of values. Most of them are measures specifying physical quantities, such as area, volume, energy consumption or CO 2 emission. These data are often defined by different standardization systems, for example data specifying one physical quantity can use different units of measure (meter and feet, kilogram and pounds, litre and gallons). There are many reasons for this constellation, for instance in different European countries, different standardisation systems are adopted. Furthermore, some data sources emerged in an ad-hoc process wherein standardisation was not really a consideration. Therefore, to facilitate the interoperability of SEMANCO's tools that use integrated data, a conversion of measures between different systems of units is required. The calculation mechanism for such conversion is a part of the query. Yet, the values for calculation as well as the vocabulary specifying units of measure are parts of the ontology.</p><p>After analysing existing ontologies, two ontology modules for units of measure management were preselected. One of these ontologies was the QUDT<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">9</ref> , and the other was the SUMO. The QUDT ontology has shown bad time performance when different reasoning tests were processed. Therefore, it was decided to use the corresponding SUMO module as the basis for implementation of the units of the system of measure of the semantic energy model. In this system all concepts whose individuals are measures of physical quantities have a data property. The domain of this property can be decimal or integer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). Furthermore, such concepts have object properties which domains are the corresponding unit of measure. For instance, the concept of Energy_Generator_Power is associated with the concept Unit_Of_Power. Each individual of Energy_Generator_Power will be associated with an individual of Unit_Of_Power, e.g. watt or joul per second. In turn each unit of measures is associated with two values: conversionOffset and the conversionMultipler. For the standard units of measure the former one is 0 and the latter one is 1. Initially, units of measure are associated with generic measures, such as Power_Measure or Energy_Measure. The generic measures, in turn, subsume concrete more specific measures such as Energy_Generator_Power or Primary_Energy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>) which inherit the relations from the generic measures. This architecture reduces the number of relations which must be explicitly specified by the user by inferring them on the fly. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Annotations</head><p>Annotations are key components of an ontology which enable users to understand its structure and ideas underlying the conceptualisation. Furthermore, these properties (e.g. name, description, references) are relevant to the technological development of the semantic energy model and to the tools developed in Work Package 5. Four annotation properties have been defined for each concept using the ontology editor:</p><p>Label. It is the formal name of the concept which will be used in the tools interface. For example, the concept of Electrical_Appliances_Power_Installed has the label of Power installed of the electrical appliances.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Contribution to overall picture</head><p>In this document we have described the most important features of the semantic energy model -a formal ontology developed in the project of SEMANCO to support the management of buildings energy and CO 2 emission related data-and the process to model it. Both the ontology and the methodology are based on current research in the fields of knowledge representation and ontology design.</p><p>The most relevant contribution of the semantic energy model is that it combines ontology design with the integration of data sources into one single process model. Thus, the applied methodology explicitly requires formal and informal mappings of data sources vocabularies and an evaluation of the ontology by means of querying data sources managed by this ontology.</p><p>In sum, the most important features of the semantic energy modelembracing 592 concepts and 468 relations implemented with 3459 axioms in DL-Lite A stylecan be summarized as the following:</p><p>-The use of selected upper-level modules of the SUMO ontology; -The application of DL-Lite A aiming at optimization of data access; and -The system for specification of units of measure that extends those provided by the SUMO module while keeping a balance between high expressivity and time performance of reasoning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Impact on other WPs and Tasks</head><p>The semantic energy model developed in this task is a core piece of the SEIF. It relies on the work done in Work Package 3 since the Standard Tables developed in Task 3.2 and Task 3.3 were used to build the ontology.</p><p>The ontology has been coded using an ontology editor developed in Task 4.3.</p><p>The purpose of the Task 4.5 Semantic energy information framework integration is to develop a federation engine which gives access to the SEMANCO tools, which are being developed in Work Package 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Contribution to demonstration</head><p>The semantic energy model developed in this task contributes in the demonstration since it is a central component of the SEIF which will enable users of the SEMANCO platform to query data stored in distributed sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Other conclusions and lessons learned</head><p>To our knowledge, the semantic energy model is one of the first implemented ontologies using the DL-Lite A formalism. The experience of its application must be of high value for the group of researchers working on data integration using semantic technologies.</p><p>Moreover, the concepts underlying the applied methodology for ontology design go beyond the state of the art. To our knowledge, a methodology combining ontology design with data integration techniques, such as formal an informal mapping of data sources vocabularies and query design has not been applied before.</p><p>2013-05-15</p><p>The ontology as well as the process modeling will be further developed as the project continues, especially in connection to the addition of more data sources.</p><p>Initially, it was planned to publish the semantic energy model in the repository supported by the ICT4e2B project (http://www.ict4e2b.eu/). After this project was completed, the European Commission migrated the repository to a new technological service platform in order to ensure its access to the research community continuity. The new site is called eeSemantics space Library (https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/eeSemantics).</p><p>The semantic energy model presented in this document will be shared with the research community in the eeSemantics space Library.</p><p>2013-05-15</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">GLOSSARY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TBox</head><p>The TBox contains the terminology of an ontology also known by intensional knowledge which usually does not change. It comprises the conceptualization statements of an ontology including concepts and relation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABox</head><p>The ABox is the assertion component of an ontology which contains the facts. It is also called extensional knowledge and includes the data modelled according to the TBox concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RDF</head><p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a directed, labelled graph specification for representing information in the Web. It is based upon the idea of making statements about resources. A resource is represented with a set of triples which are subject-predicate-object expressions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OWL</head><p>The Web Ontology Language is a knowledge representation language for coding ontologies. OWL can be used to explicitly represent the meaning of terms in vocabularies and the relationships between those terms. OWL is built on top of RDF. This representation of terms and their interrelationships is called TBox. See further information in the SEMANCO wiki: http://arc.housing.salle.url.edu/semanco/kms/index.php/OWL</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OWL formalism</head><p>OWL provides different sublanguages that offer advantages in terms of expressiveness. OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. Each of these sublanguages has dialects determined to be used in particular scenarios. This project is focused on the OWL DL Lite A dialect due to its good performance in reasoning tasks which require conjunctive queries of large data volumes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPARQL</head><p>SPARQL is a computer language used to make queries into databases stored in RDF format. SPARQL can be used to express queries across diverse data sources, whether the data is stored natively as RDF or viewed as RDF via middleware based on mappings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mappings</head><p>In the context of data integration, mappings are the explicit relations between a relational schema and an ontology. In the semantic web context, a mapping define how it is transformed the contents of a relational database into RDF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subsumption</head><p>A hierarchical relation between two concepts of an ontology. It can be used in concept specialization. When a concept is subsumed by another is called subconcept. For example, ResidentialBuilding is subsumed by Building, therefore the first concept is a sub type of the second one.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
