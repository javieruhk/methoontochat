<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Executive Summary</head><p>The COGITO Digital Twin platform aims to enable interoperability with existing and emerging standards and data models covering different domains. Semantic interoperability in the COGITO platform is based on ontologies that will be exploited throughout the COGITO infrastructure and used to semantically represent the information exchanged. This document details the methodology and technological infrastructure used to develop the COGITO ontology network, as well as the third version of the ontologies that make up such an ontology network.</p><p>The followed methodology is called Linked Open Terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[1]</ref> and includes four activities: 1) ontology requirements specification, 2) ontology implementation, 3) ontology publication, and 3) ontology maintenance.</p><p>The COGITO ontology network consists of seven modules corresponding to the facility (the construction itself), the construction process, the construction resources, the IoT devices used to locate resources, the quality achieved, the safety information related to the facility, and the entities managed by the digital twin platform (digital twins and information resources). These modules have already been conceptualised, implemented, and published and will be modified and complemented with new modules as the project progresses.</p><p>During the maintenance phase of the ontology development process, which will start after this deliverable is submitted, we expect future change requests in the ontologies due to defects found or to new requirements that may appear during integration. The COGITO ontology portal will serve as a living repository for the different ontologies and will contain the latest version of the developed ontologies and all related artifacts. Note: Since the methodology and infrastructure followed are the same as those described in in the previous versions of the COGITO Data Model and Ontology Definition and Interoperability Design (See D3.2 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and D3.3 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>), this deliverable differs from them mainly in the sections that describe new developments in the ontology, namely Sections 4 and 5. In addition, in D3.2 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> a coverage analysis was carried out to identify to what extent some of the terms that appeared in the requirements also appeared in the ontologies described in the previous D3.1 deliverable <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The conclusions highlighted the fact that reusing ontologies requires analysing multiple factors beyond coverage, and some of them are not easily quantifiable or even cannot be measured objectively. That is why we have not performed the coverage analysis for the new ontology requirements and removed that section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Scope and Objectives of the Deliverable</head><p>The COGITO Digital Twin platform aims to enable interoperability with existing and emerging standards and data models covering different domains. Semantic interoperability in the COGITO platform is based on ontologies that will be exploited throughout the COGITO infrastructure and used to semantically represent the information exchanged.</p><p>In computer science, ontologies are defined as "formal, explicit specifications of a shared conceptualization". The COGITO ontologies have been developed using the W3C Web Ontology Language standard (OWL) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , reusing existing resources and standards whenever possible. This development is based on the technical specification of the COGITO architecture and is based on a set of requirements extracted from its different components and use cases.</p><p>This deliverable describes the environment that supports the development of the COGITO ontologies. To do so, on the one hand, it describes the methodology followed to develop the ontologies and the ontology development infrastructure deployed to support such development. On the other hand, it presents the results of the different ontology development sprints. Finally, this document presents an overview of the current version of the COGITO ontologies that are available online on the COGITO ontology portal. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>The version of the ontology presented in this document is the version produced on the date of writing of this document. In any case, the COGITO ontology portal shall always contain the latest version of the ontologies and all related artifacts for ontology development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Relation to other Tasks and Deliverables</head><p>This deliverable is based on the use cases defined in D2.1-Stakeholder Requirements for the COGITO System <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[5]</ref> and on the COGITO architecture defined in D2.4-COGITO System Architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[6]</ref>. Furthermore, D3.1-Survey of Existing Models, Ontologies and Associated Standardization Efforts <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> was also considered to identify existing ontologies to reuse in the COGITO ontologies.</p><p>The COGITO ontology network described here will allow for sharing and interoperability among the different components of the COGITO architecture, especially in the communications with the Digital Twin platform. Because of this, this document has been so important when developing each component of the COGITO architecture, that is, the results of work packages 4, 5, 6, and 7 and their integration in work package 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Updates from the Previous Version</head><p>This deliverable is the third one devoted to the development of the COGITO ontologies. As in the previous version of the deliverable (v2), the sections related to the ontology development methodology and the development infrastructure are identical (sections 3 and 6, respectively) and the main changes compared to the previous versions of the deliverable are the following.</p><p>• The introduction and conclusions of the document have been updated.</p><p>• Section 3 has been updated, including the new requirements gathered for the COGITO ontology since the previous version of the deliverable. • Section 4 has been updated to include the current description of the ontology that includes the new requirements. • The section related to the coverage analysis in D3.2-COGITO Data Model and Ontology Definition and Interoperability Design v1 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> has been removed from the next versions of the deliverable. The conclusions that were extracted from such analysis highlighted the fact that reusing ontologies requires analysing multiple factors beyond coverage, and some of them are not easily quantifiable or even cannot be measured objectively. This, and the high manual effort required to perform the COGITO -GA ID. 958310</p><p>COnstruction phase diGItal Twin mOdel coverage analysis, are the reasons of not performing the coverage analysis for the new ontology requirements that have been gathered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Structure of the Deliverable</head><p>• Section 2 provides an overview of the methodology used to develop the COGITO ontologies;</p><p>• Section 3 presents the requirements that should be satisfied by the COGITO ontologies;</p><p>• Section 4 provides a description of the COGITO ontologies;</p><p>• Section 5 presents the deployed ontology development infrastructure; and</p><p>• Section 6 provides some conclusions and insights into future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Ontology Development Methodology</head><p>This section presents the ontology development methodology used for the development of the COGITO ontology network. This methodology includes four activities: 1) ontology requirements specification, 2) ontology implementation, 3) ontology publication, and 3) ontology maintenance. This development methodology is called Linked Open Terms (LOT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[1]</ref> and is based on the NeOn methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[7]</ref>. It has been used and refined in previous ontology development processes from the European projects VICINITY <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[8]</ref>, BIMERR <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[9]</ref> and DELTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[10]</ref>, and adapted to the particularities of COGITO (see Sections 3 and 4).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows an overview of the activities that are performed and the artefacts that result from them: the ontology requirements specification document (ORSD), the ontology implementation, the ontology available online, issues, bugs, etc. The following subsections detail each activity (and product). In the figures included in this section, these artefacts are represented in green squares and assigned a number; the different activities in the methodology enumerate in a green circle the numbers of all the input artefacts that are used in the activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 -Ontology development methodology followed in COGITO</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Ontological Requirements Specification</head><p>The aim of the requirements specification activity is to identify and define the requirements the ontology to be created needs to fulfil. During this first activity, it is necessary to involve experts in the domain to generate the appropriate industry perspective and knowledge. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the workflow for the ontology requirements specification activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COGITO -GA ID. 958310</head><p>COnstruction phase diGItal Twin mOdel </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Identification of Purpose and Scope</head><p>The goal of this step is to define the purpose and scope of the given ontology or module. To this end, the ontology development team works in collaboration with users and domain experts to define the purpose and scope of each ontology or module to be developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Data Exchange Identification and Use Case Specification</head><p>During this step, the ontology development team needs to gather the necessary documentation about the domain to be modelled. This documentation might correspond to the following.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Standards • Datasets • API specifications • Use cases</formula><p>This documentation needs to be collected by both the ontology development team and domain experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Ontological Requirement Proposal</head><p>Taking as input the documentation and the data provided by domain experts and users, the ontology development team generates a first proposal of ontological requirements written in the form of Competency Questions or assertions.</p><p>The format used for this requirement proposal follows a tabular approach and includes the following fields:</p><p>• Requirement identifier, which must be unique for each requirement.</p><p>• Partner who proposed the requirement.</p><p>• Component of the COGITO architecture from which the requirement was extracted.</p><p>• Sprint in which the requirement is planned to be implemented.</p><p>• Competency question or assertion.</p><p>• Status of the requirement, which can be: (1) Proposed, (2) Accepted, (3) Rejected, (4) Pending, or (5) Deprecated. • In case the requirement is deprecated, the identifier of the updated requirement is used.</p><p>• Comments on the requirement.</p><p>• Provenance of the requirement, e.g., use case or standard.</p><p>• Priority of the requirement, which can be: (1) High, (2) Medium, or (3) Low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COGITO -GA ID. 958310</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COnstruction phase diGItal Twin mOdel</head><p>The ontological requirements are completed iteratively, as the following ontology development process is incremental.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Completion and Validation of Ontology Requirements</head><p>During this activity, domain experts and users, in collaboration with the ontology development team, validate whether the ontology requirements defined in the previous step are correct and complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5">Prioritization of Ontological Requirements</head><p>Prioritization of requirements allows development teams to schedule the development of the ontology in sprints. In the COGITO project, this prioritization will be performed if there is a need to prioritise functional requirements, mainly for those sprints with a high number of requirements in which the implementation of some of the requirements has to be postponed for a future sprint.</p><p>If this prioritisation is needed, to carry it out, the ontology development team works with the domain experts to identify which requirements need to be fulfilled first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Ontology Implementation</head><p>During the implementation activity, the ontology is built using a formal language based on the requirements identified in the previous activity.</p><p>Taking the set of requirements collected in the previous activity as input, the ontology implementation activity is carried out through several sprints. To this end, the ontology developers schedule the ontology development according to the requirements that were identified, and the ontology development team builds the ontology iteratively by implementing only a certain number of requirements in each iteration. The output of each iteration is a new version of the ontology implementation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the steps that are followed in this ontology implementation activity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Ontology Conceptualization</head><p>The aim of this activity is to build an ontology model from the ontological requirements identified in the requirements specification process that represents the domain of the ontology. Therefore, during the COGITO -GA ID. 958310</p><p>COnstruction phase diGItal Twin mOdel conceptualization of the ontology, the domain knowledge obtained from the previous activity is organized and structured into a model by the ontology development team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Ontology Encoding</head><p>The purpose of the encoding activity is to implement the ontology in an implementation language such as OWL. The ontology code resulting from this activity includes, in addition to the ontology classes, properties, and axioms. Furthermore, following the FAIR principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[11]</ref>, the ontology code also includes ontology metadata, such as the creator, title, publisher, license, and version of the ontology, in addition to the metadata for each of the ontology.</p><p>To manage the ontology versions developed in the COGITO project, the following version convention was adopted. Following this convention, each release will follow the pattern v.major.minor.fix, where each field follows the rules:</p><p>• major: The field is updated when the ontology covers the entire domain that it intends to model. That is, it is a complete product and covers the final goal of the development.</p><p>• minor: The field is updated when:</p><p>o All the requirements of a subdomain are covered. o Documentation is added to the ontology. • fix: The field is updated when:</p><p>o Typos or bugs are corrected in the ontology. o Classes, relationships, axioms, individuals, or annotations are added, deleted, or modified, but the domain is not covered. In each iteration, the minor and fix fields might be changed from zero to several times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Ontology Evaluation</head><p>Once the ontology is encoded, it should be evaluated before its online publication. The development of the ontology must guarantee the following aspects:</p><p>• The ontology is consistent.</p><p>• The ontology does not have syntactic, modelling, or semantic errors.</p><p>• The ontology fulfils the requirements scheduled for the ontology, to ensure that the ontology is completed regarding the domain experts needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Ontology Publication</head><p>During the ontology publication activity, the ontology development team provides an online ontology that is accessible both as a human-readable document and as a machine-readable file from its URI. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows an overview of the steps performed during the ontology publication activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COGITO -GA ID. 958310</head><p>COnstruction phase diGItal Twin mOdel </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Propose Release Candidate</head><p>Once the ontology developers have implemented and evaluated the ontology, the next task is to decide whether the current version is going to be published on the Web (or shared among other project partners, for example, software developers making use of the ontology) or whether it is needed to document such version of the ontology for any other reason (for example, a set of requirements is fulfilled and triggers a new release). In this case, the version at hand becomes a release candidate. In case the ontology is not selected as a release, the ontology development team generates a pre-release version of the ontology. Both the release and the pre-release versions of the ontologies are evaluated and ready to be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Ontology Documentation</head><p>Taking the ontology generated in the previous activities as input, the ontology development team generates the ontology documentation. This documentation includes the following:</p><p>• An HTML description of the ontology that describes the classes, object properties, and data properties of the ontology, the license URI, and title being used. Domain experts must collaborate with the ontology development team to describe classes and properties. This description also includes metadata such as creator, publisher, date of creation, last modification, or version number. It also includes links to different formats for serialization of the ontology, such as TTL, JSON-LD, or RDF/XML. • Diagrams that store the graphical representation of the ontology, including taxonomy and class diagrams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Online Publication</head><p>During this activity, the ontology, which should already be validated and documented, is published on the Web. This ontology is accessible through its URI as a machine-readable and human-readable file using content negotiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Ontology Maintenance</head><p>During this activity, the ontology is updated, and new requirements can be proposed to be added to the ontology. Furthermore, during this activity, the ontology development team, together with domain experts and users, can identify and correct errors in the ontology. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the steps to follow in the maintenance activity of the ontology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COGITO -GA ID. 958310</head><p>COnstruction phase diGItal Twin mOdel </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Bug Detection</head><p>Once the ontology developers have published the ontology, any user, developer, or domain expert can detect and inform about bugs. This notification should be done using an issue tracker, allowing all the information related to the bug, as well as the actor that identifies it, to be stored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">New Requirements Proposal</head><p>During this activity, new requirements can be proposed for the ontology. Ontology developers, domain experts, or users can propose modifications to improve the published ontology version. This proposal should be done through an issue tracker so that all the information related to it is stored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COGITO -GA ID. 958310</head><p>COnstruction phase diGItal Twin mOdel</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Ontology Requirements Specification</head><p>Since the goal of the ontology is to facilitate the sharing and interoperability of data between COGITO components through the Digital Twin Platform (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>), we decided to analyse each component of the architecture (defined in D2.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[6]</ref>) in order to gather information about the data it needs as input from other components and the data it produces as output to other components. We also considered the information provided to and by the digital twin platform described in the different use cases.</p><p>Several meetings with the partners involved in the components and each use case have helped us specify requirements that are aligned with the needs of those components. These requirements have been organised into seven different domains related to the facility, the construction process, the resources used in that process, the Internet of Things information processed by the platform, the quality of the resulting facility, the safety information related to it, and the entities (digital twins and information resources) managed by the digital twin platform. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> presents the list of requirements for the domains we have identified.</p></div>

One part contains six ontology modules, where each module corresponds to one specific domain, namely facility<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , process, resource, IoT, quality, and safety; and the other part is a module for the entities that the digital twin platform manages (digital twins and information resources), Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> provides a graphical overview of the COGITO ontology network showing the main concepts defined in each module. To understand this figure and the ones provided in the next subsections, in which each module is explained, it is important to consider the following paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6 -Overview of the COGITO ontology network</head><p>Coloured boxes are used to represent modules currently implemented, while white boxes represent reused terms from existing ontologies. As can be seen, some of the ontologies reviewed in previous steps of the project were reused according to the results of the process described in Section 4, such as BOT and SAREF. Since the COGITO ontology only needs some IFC concepts in order to achieve interoperability, and ifcOWL is a very complex ontology, we decided to first define the main concepts of the COGITO ontology and then analyse their alignment to the IfcOWL ones (see Annex A). It should be noted that the ifcOWL version we have used is the official one, which corresponds to IFC 4.0.2.1. Some concepts relevant to COGITO, such as facility, are inspired by the IFC 4.3.0.0 ones, but have not been implemented yet in ifcOWL.</p><p>Additional cross-domain ontologies, such as geo and dcterms, were also reused once requirements and conceptualizations were analysed in detail. The prefixes, and corresponding ontologies, created and reused in the COGITO ontology are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>, respectively.</p><p>The main hierarchies between concepts are also included and ad hoc relations between different modules and within modules are also present. Arrows are used to represent these properties between classes and to represent some RDF, RDFS, and OWL constructs. More precisely:</p><p>• Plain arrows with white triangles represent the subclass relationship between two classes. The origin of the arrows is the class to be declared as a subclass of the class at the destination of the arrow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Plain arrows between two classes indicate that the object property has declared as domain the class</head><p>in the origin, and as range the class in the destination of the arrow. The identifier of the object property is indicated in the arrow. • Dashed labelled arrows between two classes indicate that the object property can be instantiated between the classes in the origin and the destination of the arrow. The identifier of the object property is indicated in the arrow. • Dashed arrows with the identifiers between stereotype signs (i.e., "&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;") refer to OWL constructs that are applied to some ontology elements, that is, they can be applied to classes or properties depending on the OWL construct being used. • Dashed arrows without identifiers are used to represent the rdf:type relation, indicating that the element in the origin is an instance of the class in the destination of the arrow.</p><p>Datatype properties are denoted by rectangles attached to the classes, in a UML-oriented way. Dashed boxes represent datatype properties that can be applied to the class it is attached to, while plain boxes represent that the domain of the datatype property is declared to be the class attached.</p><p>For more details about the graphical notation used in this diagram, you can check the Chowlk Visual Notation<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> .</p><p>The complete and up-to-date documentation of each ontology module is provided online, as explained in Section 3. In the rest of this section, only the main concepts and modelling decisions are detailed.</p></div>

This new class includes facility:Railway, facility:Bridge, facility:Road, and facility:Building. • facility:FacilityPart is defined as something that is usually contained (facility:hasFacilityPart) in a facility:Facility. A facility:FacilityPart can contain other facility parts (facility:hasFacilityPart). • facility:Storey is defined as a subclass of bot:Storey and, as such, is contained (bot:hasStorey) in a facility:Building and is intended to contain (bot:hasSpace) one or more facility:Space that are horizontally connected. • facility:Element is defined as a subclass or bot:Element and, as such, a constituent of a construction entity with a characteristic technical function, form, or position. A facility:Element can contain subelements (bot:hasSubElement). A facility:SpatialZone can contain (bot:hasElement) some facility:Elements. A beo:BuildingElement is a subclass of facility:Element. Its facility:material property is considered when processing visual quality.</p><p>The BOT subclasses have been created because they have specific properties such as rdfs:label and dcterms:identifier. They are also subclasses of geo:SpatialObject in order to reuse its location properties.</p></div>

The development of these ontologies has been aligned with the gathering of requirements and the specification of the COGITO architecture.</p><p>The current version of the COGITO ontology network (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) consists of seven modules, corresponding to the facility (the construction itself), the construction process, the construction resources, the IoT devices used to locate the resources, the quality achieved, the safety information related to the facility, and the entities managed by the digital twin platform (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>). These modules have already been conceptualised, implemented, and published in a third version of the COGITO ontologies.</p><p>In D3.2 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> a coverage analysis was carried out identifying to what extent some of the terms appearing in the requirements also appeared in the ontologies described in the previous D3.1 deliverable <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The conclusions highlighted the fact that reusing ontologies requires analysing multiple factors beyond coverage, and some of them are not easily quantifiable or even cannot be measured objectively. Therefore, no new coverage analysis was executed for the new ontology requirements.</p><p>The COGITO ontology network allows for the sharing and interoperability among the different components of the COGITO architecture, especially in the communications with the Digital Twin platform. That is why this document has been so important when developing each component of the COGITO architecture, that is, the results of work packages 4, 5, 6, and 7, and their integration in work package 8.</p><p>During the maintenance phase of the ontology development process, which will start after this deliverable is submitted, we expect future change requests in the ontologies due to defects found or to new requirements that may appear during integration. The COGITO ontology portal will serve as a living repository for the different ontologies and will contain the latest version of the developed ontologies and all related artifacts.</p><p>COGITO -GA ID. 958310</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Platform Module</head><p>The current conceptual model defined for the Platform module is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">13</ref>. The main classes and properties of this module are the following:</p><p>• A platform:PlatformThing is a subclass of a td:Thing and, as such, an abstraction of a physical or a virtual entity whose metadata and interfaces are described by a WoT Thing Description. In this case, an entity of the digital twin platform. • A platform:DigitalTwin is a subclass of a platform:PlatformThing including projects (facility:Project) and elements (facility:Element). • A qual:InformationResource, is a subclass of a platform:PlatformThing including all the kinds of information resources used to derive the quality (see section 4.5) and that need to be stored. • Subproperties of td:links and td:forms that specify the relations between a platform:PlatformThing and a td:Link and a td:Form have been created.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Infrastructure to Support the Ontology Implementation Activity</head><p>To support the implementation activity, the ontology development team uses several tools to edit, store, and evaluate the ontology.</p><p>• For ontology edition, the ontology development team uses Protégé, 6 which allows the creation, visualisation, and manipulation of ontologies. • For ontology storage, the ontology development team uses GitHub The development team uses the OnToology 8 tool to generate documentation and evaluate the ontology. OnToology, which integrates the tools Widoco 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[12]</ref> and OOPS! 10 [13], automatically generates a folder in the GitHub repository that includes the resources: diagrams, documentation, and evaluation report.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Infrastructure to Support the Ontology Publication Activity</head><p>To support the publication activity, the ontology development team creates an ontology portal online to make the ontology and all the associated information (repository, requirements, tests, releases, etc.) to users. This ontology portal has different sections:</p><p>• Ontologies • How we work</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.1">Ontologies</head><p>The Ontologies section, which is the main section of the portal, shows the main information about the ontologies created in the COGITO ontology network. Figure <ref type="figure">16</ref> shows an overview of the information exposed in this section of the portal. The section follows a tabular approach that includes the following:</p><p>• Link to the ontology documentation published on the Web  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.2">How We Work</head><p>Regarding the section "how we work", it provides a brief overview of the proposed process for developing ontologies and some guidelines, which should be useful to anyone who wants to contribute to the ontologies. This section includes information about the following.</p><p>• How should the repository be structured.</p><p>• Tools recommended to be used during the ontology development process.</p><p>• Ontology versioning.</p><p>• Management of issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Infrastructure to Support the Ontology Maintenance Activity</head><p>To provide support for maintenance activity, ontology developers use the GitHub issue tracker, which manages and maintains the list of issues identified by domain experts and ontology developers. The GitHub issue tracker provides the status of the issue, assignee, and description, and allows one to add comments to the issue to discuss about it. Each issue tracker is associated with a GitHub repository and consequently with an ontology in the COGITO ontology network.</p><p>To manage changes in the ontology, all new proposals and improvements must be agreed upon by all members of the ontology development team. If domain experts, users, or ontology developers want to add, delete, or modify concepts in the ontology, they must create a new issue in the GitHub issue tracker associated with the ontology to be modified, which will be used to discuss the approval or rejection of the proposal. Figure <ref type="figure">17</ref> shows the GitHub issue tracker for one of the COGITO ontologies.</p><p>COGITO -GA ID. 958310 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IfcTask</head><p>An IfcTask is an identifiable unit of work to be carried out in a construction project. A task is typically used to describe an activity for the construction or installation of products, but is not limited to these types. For example, it might be used to describe design processes, move operations, and other design, construction, and operation related activities as well. The quantities of resources consumed by the task are dealt with by defining the IfcElementQuantity for the resource and not in the instance of IfcTask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related concepts</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>process:WorkOrder</head><p>Is defined as a command or instruction authorizing specific work, repairs, etc., to be done. It has a main provider (resource:hasMainProvider), which is a resource:HumanWorker, and belongs to (process:hasWorkOrder) a process:Process. There can be some qual:Image and qual:PointCloud related to a process:WorkOrder. It is important to know if a process:WorkOrder is completed (process:status).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IfcWorkPlan</head><p>A work plan contains a set of work schedules for different purposes (including construction and facility management). Contained work schedules are defined through the IfcRelAggregates relationship. Through inheritance from IfcWorkControl, it is also possible to define references to activities (for example, IfcTask) and resources used in the work plan.</p><p>A work plan has information such as start date, finish date, total free float, etc. IfcWorkPlan can also refer to the construction project represented by the single IfcProject instance (please also check the definition of IfcWorkControl). Is defined as a source of supply, support, or aid, especially one that can be readily drawn upon when needed. resource:HumanWorker, resource:Equipment and resource:trackingTrack are subclasses of resource:Resource. It is also a subclass of geo:SpatialThing in order to reuse its location properties. A resource:Resource belongs to a resource:ResourceType.</p><p>IfcConstructionResource is an abstract generalization of the different resources used in construction projects, mainly labour, material, equipment, and product resources, plus subcontracted resources and aggregations such as a crew resource.</p><p>IfcResource contains the information needed to represent the costs, schedule, and other impacts from the use of something in a process. It is not intended to use IfcResource to model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional linkage from IfcResource to the things to be used can be specified (specifically, the relationship from the subtypes of IfcResource to IfcProduct through the IfcRelAssignsToResource relationship).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>resource:ResourceType</head><p>Is defined as the kind of resources assigned to a process:Task or involved in a process:Process, indicating their maximum quantity (resource: maxUnit) and cost (resource:costPerHour). resource:HumanRole, resource:EquipmentType and resource:trackingTrackGroup are subclasses of resource:ResourceType.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IfcConstructionResourceType</head><p>IfcConstructionResourceType is an abstract generalization of the different resource types used in construction projects, mainly labour, material, equipment, and product resource types, plus subcontracted resource types and aggregations such as a crew resource type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TypeResource</head><p>IfcTypeResource defines a specific (or type) definition of a resource. It is used to define a resource specification (the specific resource that is common to all occurrences that are defined for that resource) and could act as a resource template.</p><p>An IfcTypeResource may have a list of property sets attached. Values of these properties are common to all occurrences of that resource type. The type of occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType.</p></div>
