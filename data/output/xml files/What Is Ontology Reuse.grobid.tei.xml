<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The reuse of ontologies is critical to their value as a means of knowledge representation. Unfortunately, reuse also still poses a considerable challenge for the ontological community. One reason for this is the lack of a formal definition of reuse. How can we attempt to perform or even assist this sort of ontology design, if we have no clear understanding of what constitutes reuse, and what does not? In this work we aim to remedy this situation by providing a formal definition of the concepts of reuse and reusability. Beyond providing a clear understanding of these concepts, part of the resulting definition is a characterization of the operations of reuse that can be leveraged to determine how a given ontology(s) must be reused to satisfy some specified requirements. This serves not only to provide direction for the task of reuse, but also to assess the implications of reusing an ontology(s), a priori. Collectively, the solutions presented in this paper serve as a major step in improving the current state of reuse.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Reusability has long been recognized as a key attribute of ontologies, yet the principles and practice of reuse remain underdeveloped. The current lack of design through reuse presents a serious problem for the ontology community. While there are a variety of alternative approaches to knowledge representation, part of the case for ontologies is that they provide a knowledge representation that is not only unambiguous but adaptable, shareable, and reusable. Given that the reuse of ontologies remains such a challenging task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, the benefits of shareability and reusability are often discounted.</p><p>Advocates of ontologies often claim that one benefit is that they are reusable. This is certainly true in principle, given that there are many generic concepts likely to appear (and thus be reused) in multiple applications. However, this is irrelevant if ontologies are not being reused in practice; if reuse is not commonplace we cannot claim that reusability is a benefit of ontologies. The value of ontologies is also motivated by the benefit of shareability. In general, this assumes that ontologies are developed with reuse. When an ontology is reused in the development of other ontologies, its semantics should be readily shared across their applications. If reuse does not occur, shareability may still be possible, but there will be no instances in which information can readily be shared between applications. Without these supposed benefits, the case for ontological solutions is less than convincing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">The Definition of Reuse: A Key Issue</head><p>Despite various attempts to aid and facilitate the reuse of ontologies, it remains a serious problem for the community. This is by no means an indication of ineffective or poor quality work, but a result of the difficulty of the problem. The scope of the problem of reuse is broad and poorly defined. In part, this is because reuse itself is currently not well-understood. There exist many approaches to reuse <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , formalized to various degrees, and yet there is no clear definition of what it means to develop an ontology via reuse, and precisely what this entails.</p><p>Not only does this lack of understanding inhibit the widespread practice of reuse, but where reuse does occur, the lack of a formal definition allows for the introduction of serious issues. Specifically, in the current state there are many instances where an ontology is said to be reused, but its semantics are completely changed. Situations such as this raise a key question: What does it mean if one ontology is said to have reused another? What can we infer from this?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Approach</head><p>We address these issues with several contributions. In Section 3 we derive a wellfounded, formal definition for reuse from the notion of intended models. Through this definition, we define detailed reuse operations that completely characterize all possible cases of reuse. In Section 4, we discuss how it is possible to determine what reuse operations are required, and therefore provide explicit guidance and valuable insight for the task of reuse. The definition provides a concrete understanding of what it means to reuse an ontology (or ontologies), as well as the necessary concepts to describe reuse at an effective level of detail. This serves to improve both our understanding of reuse and our ability to support it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Currently, we find no formal definition of ontology reuse accepted or even proposed within the community. Nearly all work pertaining to the task of reuse assumes some implicit definition of the reuse of an ontology; no effort is made, formal or otherwise, to provide further clarification of precisely what this entails. An exception to this is found in the sort of definition presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where the authors describe reuse as: ...the process in which available (ontological) knowledge is used as input to generate new ontologies. This is a very broad definition, and its lack of specificity not only limits its usefulness but, we will see later, is also inaccurate in its generality.</p><p>A similar, implicit definition may be found when reviewing the guidelines for reuse in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, where the authors' customizing activity (Activity 2) accounts for a wide range of loosely defined operations (pruning, enriching, translating, and adapting the selected ontology). Without any justification or precise definition of what these operations entail, it appears as though the authors also consider reuse to include any scenario in which an available ontology is used as an input in the development of a new one. Attempting to extract an implicit definition from other existing guidelines only reinforces that this vague definition is generally accepted by the community.</p><p>At best, we find that some more specific, related, and sometimes overlapping subtypes of reuse have been defined, such as merging and alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, modular or 'safe' reuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and the application of ontology patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Even with the provision of examples and guidelines, these implicit definitions remain either vague or isolated to a specific type of reuse. No existing work has provided a concrete understanding of precisely what is, and what is not ontology reuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Defining Reuse</head><p>In ontology design, we are attempting to create a set of axioms that captures some intended semantics of a set of concepts. Reuse is often conceptualized as a special case of design; intuitively, it refers to the task of taking some existing ontology(s) and manipulating it in some way in order to satisfy the design requirements. This observation is supported by existing, informal definitions of reuse.</p><p>In addition, there is an implicit condition which is often not stated as it is perhaps assumed as common sense -reuse can only be performed on a reusable ontology. To illustrate this with an example, consider the development of a finance ontology. It would be possible to take some existing anatomy ontology, and through some series of operations create the required finance ontology. However, if no remnants of the anatomy ontology are preserved in the finance ontology then we would not really want to consider such behaviour to be reuse. In fact, in such a case we may as well have developed the finance ontology from scratch. While the intuition of manipulating an existing ontology is certainly a necessary part of reuse, it is not sufficient to define reuse. In order to define reuse, we first consider the notion of reusability in more detail and produce a formal definition. Following this, we define the different possible reuse operations, by which an ontology may be manipulated. The combination of the classification of operations and the condition of reusability will form the definition of reuse that we present here.</p><p>It is important to note that the work that follows is restricted in that it does not consider any signature translations of the ontology to be reused; in other words, we assume that the theories to be reused are axiomatized in the required signature, where applicable. This assumption is made in order to simplify the presentation of the definition, and while this may seem to be an oversimplification it is in fact quite reasonable. If an ontology has been selected for reuse, then the developer must at least implicitly observe some mappings between its signature and those of the requirements. It is then simple enough to satisfy the assumption of a shared signature through the application of these mappings between the signatures of the candidate and required theories. A straightforward process to accomplish this has in fact been suggested in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The definition presented here also assumes that no language translations are required; in other words the reused ontology(s) are in the same logical language as the ontology being developed. While not ideal, this is the norm in the current state and therefore a reasonable assumption to make.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Reusability</head><p>A perspective on the goal of ontology design is that its aim is to develop a set of axioms that captures the intended models. It follows that to satisfy the requirements with existing theories, we should be reusing theories that in some way characterize one or more of the different domains that comprise the class of the intended models (recall, we denote these as M intended ). As discussed, a key distinction between reuse and traditional development is that with the concept of reuse there is an implicit constraint on the acceptable (re-) design of the axioms. Simply put, if we claim that some ontology(s) has been reused, we expect and in fact should require that some remnants of the original ontology remain in the resulting ontology. For any ontology T that is reused to satisfy M intended , the models of T must characterize at least some of the models of some part of M intended . We can restate this condition as saying that each model in M intended must map to a model of T , or a model of a subtheory<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> of T . Depending on the nature of the ontology to be reused, M intended may only map to some of the models of T as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (i.e. if T is weaker than the required ontology). Note that we denote the models of an ontology T as Mod(T ).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. If the ontology is weaker than required, the intended models will only map to some of the models of its axiomatization. This and subsequent figures are adaptations of the depiction of intended models, originally from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, M intended may map to models outside of Mod(T ), i.e. models of some subtheory of T ; this may occur if T is either stronger or incomparable to the required ontology, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, respectively.</p><p>An additional factor to account for is that the class of intended models may characterize one or many different domains. For example, consider the design of an enterprise ontology: M intended will likely cover concepts of organizations, actors, dates, and so on. However, we do not necessarily expect to be able to reuse a single ontology that completely covers these enterprise-related concepts. More likely, we hope to find useful theories that contribute to the various required domains; we may reuse some ontology of time, another ontology of dates, and perhaps another ontology of organizations. In such cases, it is not all of M intended that maps in some way to T , but a reduct of M intended where the models are restricted so some sub-signature (e.g. only the time-related con-Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. If the ontology is stronger than required, the intended models will map to models of a subtheory its axiomatization.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. If the ontology is incomparable to the required ontology, the intended models will only map to some of the models of a subtheory of its axiomatization. cepts). Similarly, there are cases where T may have a larger signature than that of the intended models. For example, in the design of our enterprise ontology we may reuse an ontology of time that is in fact part of a larger ontology for scheduling. In this case, the reduct of M intended maps to a reduct of the models of T . Therefore the diagrams that we have been considering do not necessarily capture mappings between the intended models and the models of the reused ontology, but the reducts of these models as shown more precisely in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref>. To account for mismatches in the scope of the required and reused ontology's concepts, we consider mappings between the reducts of the models. Thus L 1 may in fact be a sub-language (sub-signature) of the signature of the intended models, which we denote σ (M intended ), and similarly L 2 may be a sub-language (sub-signature) of the candidate's signature, which we denote σ (T ).</p><p>Here, we extend the usual meaning of a reduct, (denoted by M | σ ) of a single model, M , to some sub-signature, σ , of its original signature to apply to an entire class of models. Formally, we denote this Red(M, σ ), and define it as follows:</p><p>Definition 1. The reduct of a class of models M to some signature σ is defined as the class of structures consisting of the reducts of each model M in M to the signature σ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Red(M, σ ) = {N : N ∼ = M | σ , M ∈ M}</formula><p>Collecting all of these observations, we can refine our intuitions to say more specifically that if an ontology T is reusable to satisfy M intended , then there must be a mapping from the reducts of M intended to reducts of models of T , a subtheory of T with the same signature. Formally, Definition 2. T is reusable for M intended iff: there is a mapping π : Red(M intended , σ 1 ) → Red(Mod(T ), σ 2 ) where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• T ⊆ T , • σ (T ) = σ (T ) • σ 1 ⊆ σ (M intended ) • σ 2 ⊆ σ (T )</formula><p>It is straightforward to extend this definition to apply to a collection of ontologies; the same intuition applies: Definition 3. For a set of ontologies, T 1 ,...T n , we say that the set T 1 ,...T n is reusable for</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M intended iff each T i is reusable for M intended .</formula><p>This notion of reusability can be captured similarly, from the perspective of the theories' axiomatizations. Note that owing to our definition of an ontology being the logical closure of a set of axioms, the ⊆ symbol denotes a subtheory as opposed to simply a subset of axioms. We use T h(M) to denote the axiomatization of a class of models M. Theorem 1. A set of ontologies T 1 ,...T n is reusable for M intended iff T h(M intended ) contains non-trivial subtheories of T 1 ,...,T n . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Classification of Reuse Operations</head><p>While it is tempting to interpret Theorem 1 as a definition of reuse, it would be inaccurate to do so. Certainly, for any ontology that has been reused, we expect that it must have been reusable and thus we expect the results of reuse are captured by Theorem 1. In fact, the theorem captures the basic intuition of reuse that motivated the definition of reusability: in order for Design to qualify as reuse, we expect some remnants of the original ontology(s) to remain. However, reusability is a necessary but not sufficient condi-tion for reuse. There is an extralogical condition that must be accounted for in order to completely capture what it means to reuse an ontology. Unlike reusability, reuse is not a static property between theories; reuse refers to an act that is performed with some existing theories, in the design of an ontology. Simply because an ontology is reusable for some intended models does not mean it will or has been be reused to axiomatize those models.</p><p>Informally, reuse is the act of applying some operations to a given, reusable ontology(s), such that the final result axiomatizes the intended models. To formally define reuse, these operations must be completely identified and defined. While various approaches to reuse, such as ontology fusion, merging, and extension, have been identified in varying degrees of detail in the current state, none of these approaches have been defined with respect to a complete definition of reuse; in some cases they have not been defined formally at all. Here, we provide a precise definition for a set of operations that completely covers the possible approaches to reuse. The terms used here should be interpreted independently of those that have been identified in the literature. No relationships should be inferred or assumed due to a similarity of terms or descriptions.</p><p>The following are the 4 distinct reuse operations by which an ontology may be manipulated for reuse: as is, extraction, extension, and combination. These operations are natural and fairly obvious approaches to manipulating an ontology; the focus here is on the way in which we define them, and the subsequent analysis they are capable of supporting. With the exception of as is, for each of these operations, we identify three more precise, specialized operations based on a more precise identification of the changes to the original ontology.</p><p>As is refers to a sort of null operation. This corresponds to the reuse of an ontology directly, with no modifications of any sort. In this sense, it is analogous to an identity function and we consider it to be a trivial operation. It can be formally defined as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">- sub ⊂ T -such that σ (T - sub ) ∩ σ (T /T - sub ) = / 0 or σ (T /T - sub ) = σ (T )</formula><p>The first two operations addressed the sort of do-nothing operation, and the operation to remove axioms from an ontology. Now we consider the operations to add axioms to an ontology; the way that this occurs depends on the source of the axioms -they could be new axioms, created during design by the ontology developer, or they could be existing axioms, reused from some other ontology. It is important to make this distinction because these differences affect the way in which reuse is carried out. If the axioms were reused from another ontology, the design work is minimal, however if they are new axioms then the developer must have invested some time to design them from-scratch. The distinction between these two types of axiom addition also has potential implications for the perception of the resulting shareability. If the additional axioms were reused from some other ontology it may indicate that shareability will also be supported with this ontology; at the very least it indicates that shareability is something that should be considered and addressed in the metadata. We formalize this distinction by considering whether the additional axioms may be found in some repository. If axioms are added to one ontology (by reuse of axioms) from another ontology, then a combination has occurred. Otherwise, the addition is simply an extension of the ontology with additional axioms. We make reference to a single repository for simplicity, however it is straightforward to see that the definition and subsequent results also apply for any number of repositories or other sources of ontologies.</p><p>Extension refers to the reuse of an ontology via the creation and introduction of new axioms, denoted by T + . It can be formally defined as follows: Strengthening Extension: the original ontology is extended via a new set of axioms created by the developer, T + , such that its semantics are strengthened while maintaining its scope.

Such a definition appeals to our intuition: reuse is the application of some set of reuse operations; however the act of reuse cannot be defined via these operations alone.

Reuse is defined as the act of performing some set of operations on some existing ontology(s) T 1 ,...,T n<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> that is reusable for some M intended , in order to transform T 1 , ..., T n to T h(M intended ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Implications</head><p>The definitions presented in the previous section fill a critical void for the task of ontology reuse. In order for ontology development to move toward becoming an engineering discipline, concepts like reuse and its operations must be clearly understood and defined. Here, we consider the implications of the definitions presented in the previous section; in particular, the improved understanding and the opportunities for reuse support that they provide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Validation of Reuse Operations</head><p>The reuse operations defined not only help to identify the sorts of manipulations that may be performed, they provide a complete characterization of the possible ways in which an ontology(s) may be reused; through this they achieve an explicit understanding of what is, and what is not reuse. Theorem 2. Let S be some ontology repository, and let T 1 , ..., T n be some ontologies in S. If an ontology or set of ontologies T 1 ,...T n is reusable for M intended there exists a set of specialized reuse operations on T 1 ,...,T n to axiomatize M intended .</p><p>Proof Sketch Consider the reuse of a single theory T for M intended . There are 4 possible relationships between T and T h(M intended ). For each relationship, the necessary reuse operation to axiomatize T h(M intended ) follows by definition of the operations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">• T |= T h(M intended ) → extraction(T, T -) = T h(M intended ) for some T - • T h(M intended ) |= T → extension(T, T + ) = T h(M intended ) for some T + • T = T h(M intended ) → as is(T ) • T T h(M intended ) → extension(extraction(T, T -), T + ) for some T -, T +</formula><p>where the symbol denotes that two theories are incomparable</p><p>The extension of this result for multiple theories T 1 ,...T n is straightforward and relies on the commutativity of reuse operations; by combining the theories we can reduce this case to the reuse of a single theory. Theorem 2 confirms that our definition of reuse operations has in fact covered all cases of reuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Guiding Ontology Reuse</head><p>Not only does there exist some set of operations to axiomatize the intended models, we can in fact leverage the definitions to determine precisely what operations are required. This result comes about by way of a constructive proof of Theorem 2. As outlined in the proof sketch presented in the previous section, the approach relies on assessing the relationship between T h(M intended ) and the ontology(s) to be reused. Assuming that T is reusable for M intended , we can completely characterize all possible reuse cases based on the relationship between the signature and the axioms of T h(M intended ) and T . This result can also be extended to identify the specialized reuse operations required, and follows directly from the full proof of Theorem 2. Thus for any ontology, either a priori or post-reuse, the developer may assess what reuse operations must be or were applied. This is valuable in both providing guidance for reuse, and also in assessing precisely how a particular ontology was reused.</p><p>In practice, T h(M intended ) will likely not be known completely and thus some approximation (such as the set of competency questions) will be substituted. While the use of competency question (CQs) as requirements is well-established, their role as approximating the required ontology, T h(M intended ), may be subject to speculation. We defend this approach from a pragmatic standpoint; at this stage in development, no better approximation of the ontology exists. Certainly, there is a difficulty that the greater the precision of the CQs, the closer the developer is to developing the ontology from-scratch, however this challenge exists for the task of requirements specification across all sorts of disciplines: a compromise between precision and practicality must be found. The use of an approximation of the required ontology is not something that is unique to this approach to reuse, it is a norm of development methodologies in general and thus should not be regarded as a weakness of this approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Assessing Shareability</head><p>Extraction, extension and combination may be performed in several distinct ways, each of which has a different intuition and impact on the resulting ontology. The specializations of the reuse operations are based on a more precise identification of these changes to the original ontology. Not only does this provide more detailed guidance with respect to the required operations, it allows for a more detailed analysis of the implications of any given reuse scenario. The identification of these operations facilitates recognition of the relationships between concepts in the original ontology(s) and the resulting ontology being developed via reuse. Most notably, this supports the identification of shareability that is attained or lost for concepts in the new ontology.</p><p>The identification of necessary specialized operations may also be used as a sort of look-ahead in order to inform developers of the implications that reuse of a particular ontology will have on its semantics, and consequently the resulting shareability that can be expected. In the case that multiple reuse operations are necessary, the assessment of the resulting shareability follows easily: any operation that does not preserve the semantics of T implies that overall, its semantics are not preserved. The assessment on the resulting semantics is similar for cases where multiple ontologies are reused. The result serves to inform the developer of the shareability between the resulting ontology and the reused theories. In effect, it enables us to give a useful answer the question: What does it mean if one ontology is said to have reused another?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Other Operations on Ontologies</head><p>The reader may note that the notion of ontology operations itself is not novel. Work on ontology algebras, belief revision, and the Distributed Ontology Language (DOL) standard have particular resonance. We review each of these areas here and discuss the relationship to this work. It is critical to note that the novelty of the current work is not in the identification of the operations themselves, rather, the contribution we make is the way in which we interpret these operations, in the context of a formal definition of reuse. The perspective we take in defining these operations is such that they can serve to both prescribe how an ontology can be reused to satisfy a given set of requirements, and to assess what the implications of this reuse will be on the resulting ontology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1.">Ontology Algebras</head><p>The ontology algebras presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> are designed to support ontology integration, thus the resulting operations focus on composing ontologies when global consistency is not feasible. We observe that similarities are evident between the operators defined in this work and the reuse operations we identify here. In particular, the combination and extraction operations may be captured by operators defined for ontology algebras. A major distinction here is that the role of the algebra operators is to support the integration ontologies, thus their attention is on the combinations of ontologies. The intersection and difference operators defined for the ontology algebra do not correspond to any of the reuse operations we define here, as these distinctions are not relevant for our purposes; nor do the algebras define any sorts of extension operations, as their focus is on the combination of existing theories, not the addition of new axioms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2.">Belief Revision and the AGM Framework</head><p>The reader may also have noticed similarities between the identified operations and the well-known AGM Framework for belief revision <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.It defines operations, or ways in which beliefs can change. The notion of revising a set of beliefs to resolve inconsistencies is thus one of particular importance. In the context of ontologies, the AGM Framework may be considered as a tool to approach ontology evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Conceptually, the extraction, extension, and combination operations could all be described in the AGM Framework, albeit without the sorts of distinctions that are made between the specializations. On the other hand, there are belief revision operations such as revision and consolidation do not correspond to any of the reuse operations defined here. Again, a major distinction is that the purpose of these operations is to update the belief set and arrive at a consistent set of beliefs, whereas the reuse operations are manipulating existing ontology(s) in order to arrive at a specific end result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3.">DOL</head><p>The Distributed Ontology Language (DOL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, has been designed in response to the OntoIOP request for proposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to address the challenge of interoperability for heterogeneous formal representations. The DOL project considers not only ontologies, but 'specifications and MDE [Model-Driven Engineering] models' in a variety of languages, and is focused not on reuse but on integration and interoperability. While the scope of this project is much broader and not quite aligned with the work presented here, we find that the 'structuring language for OMS' provided by DOL corresponds in a way to the concept of reuse operations. A key distinction is that the language in DOL defines constructs, which are meant to describe the structure of theories and how they relate to one another, as opposed to the definition of operations here which represents a manipulation performed on a given ontology.</p><p>Each of the reuse operations defined here may be expressed by some DOL construct. However certain distinctions such as the difference between the original and resulting signature that are made when considering operations in the context of reuse, are not captured by these constructs as they are simply not relevant when defining metalogical relationships between theories. As mentioned, the DOL constructs provide a means of describing the structure of an ontology such that we can understand its relationship to other ontologies. The concept of an 'original' (reused) ontology, or even the source of axioms (another ontology, or created by the developer) make little sense from this perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>The definition of reuse presented here is not only novel, but the first of its kind. No definition of reuse or complete characterization of operations has been provided for the community before. While there are certainly other challenges that present barriers for the reuse of ontologies, the work presented in this paper serves as a substantial contribution towards the goal of reuse becoming a more principled and effective means of ontology design. We developed definitions for the concepts of reuse and reusability that are not only formal but functional. We presented a precise set of reuse operations that, in any possible case, could be applied to an ontology in order to satisfy some specified requirements. Not only are the operations capable of providing valuable guidance for reuse, perhaps more crucially they provide a means of assessing and understanding the implications of a given instance of reuse.</p><p>Of particular interest for the task of ontology reuse are the relationships identified between the reuse operations and the constructs specified in DOL. The correspondences that we have identified present an opportunity to extend implementation of this work to capture any resulting ontologies in the DOL terminology, which is an OMG adopted specification. For example, it will be straightforward to translate the necessary reuse operations to axiomatize the intended models from some T 1 ,...T n , in order to define the structure of the resulting ontology using the metalogical relationships of DOL. This has the potential to ease adoption of the DOL standard, and also to benefit reuse with the provision of standardized metadata detailing the reuse of ontologies.</p><p>We hope that future work will look towards the adoption of the approach to reuse presented here in a more user-friendly medium, perhaps integrated with existing ontology design tools. While this work provides the necessary theory to support reuse, tool support to implement this definition would be an invaluable contribution towards simplifying and improving the practice of reuse.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4.
